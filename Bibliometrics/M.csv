IN LONG-TAILED MACAQUES, THESE FRIENDLY REUNIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RESTORE ASPECTS OF THE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE OPPONENTS TO THEIR PRECONFLICT STATE, AND THEY HAVE THUS BEEN INTERPRETED AS RECONCILIATIONS. ALTHOUGH POSTCONFLICT RECONCILIATION WOULD SEEM TO BE ADAPTIVE TO GREGARIOUS ANIMALS THAT ESTABLISH INDIVIDUALIZED SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, ITS OCCURRENCE IS VARIABLE AMONG SPECIES, GROUPS AND DYADS. SOME OF THIS VARIATION PROBABLY REFLECTS COSTS AND BENEFITS OF RECONCILING IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. ONE FACTOR THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE THE BENEFIT OF RECONCILIATION AND HENCE ITS OCCURRENCE IS THE VALUE OF THE SOCIAL PARTNER AS A SOCIAL OR ECOLOGICAL RESOURCE: RECONCILIATION SHOULD OCCUR MORE OFTEN AFTER FIGHTS WITH VALUABLE SOCIAL PARTNERS. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING PAIRS OF MONKEYS (MACACA FASCICULARIS) AS THEIR OWN CONTROLS. FIRST, BASELINE RATES OF RECONCILIATION AFTER EXPERIMENTER-INDUCED CONFLICT WERE MEASURED. THEN, THE VALUE OF THE RELATIONSHIP, AT LEAST IN THE TEST CONTEXT, WAS INCREASED BY TRAINING EACH PAIR OF MONKEYS TO PERFORM A SIMPLE COOPERATIVE TASK IN WHICH EACH GOT ACCESS TO FOOD ONLY IF THE PARTNER FED NEARBY SIMULTANEOUSLY. FINALLY, THE RECONCILIATION RATE WAS MEASURED AGAIN AFTER TRAINING AND COMPARED TO ITS BASELINE VALUE. IN 6 OF 7 DYADS, THE RECONCILIATION RATE INCREASED AFTER TRAINING, AND THE MEDIAN RECONCILIATION RATE AFTER TRAINING WAS 3 TIMES HIGHER THAN AT BASELINE. WHILE THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE HYPOTHESIS, THERE ARE OTHER POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS. COMPARISON OF FRIENDLY BEHAVIOR WHEN THERE HAD BEEN NO PRIOR AGGRESSION IN BASELINE AND POST-TRAINING PHASES, HOWEVER, SUGGESTED THAT THE INCREASE IN RECONCILIATION RATE WAS NEITHER THE RESULT OF A GENERAL INCREASE IN COMPATIBILITY NOR THE RESULT OF ANTICIPATED CONFLICT IN THE COFEEDING CONTEXT.","UNIV ZURICH,CH-8006 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND.;",NA,"ARTICLE",NA,NA,"4","ETHOLOGY","ETHOLOGY","ENGLISH",1993,"CORDS, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), COLUMBIA UNIV,DEPT ANTHROPOL,NEW YORK,NY 10027, USA.","ETHOLOGY",73,"RECONCILING WITH VALUABLE PARTNERS BY LONGTAILED MACAQUES","WOS:A1993LC73100005","93","ISI","UNIV ZURICH","COLUMBIA UNIV",NA,"CORDS M, 1993, ETHOLOGY","CORDS M, 1993, ETHOLOGY"

THE PUZZLE IS WHY SELFISH INDIVIDUALS DID NOT SUBVERT COHESIVE GROUP BEHAVIOUR BY TAKING RESOURCES WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROUP'S OVERALL SUCCESS. KIN SELECTION AND RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM ARE THE TWO STANDARD EXPLANATIONS FOR GROUP COHESION. BUT MANY GROUPS HAVE EVOLVED INTO COOPERATIVE UNITS WHEN RELATEDNESS WAS LOW AND OPPORTUNITIES WERE LIMITED FOR THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES REQUIRED FOR RECIPROCITY. A NEW THEORY WAS RECENTLY PROPOSED IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS INVEST SOME OF THEIR RESOURCES INTO REPRESSING COMPETITION BETWEEN GROUP MEMBERS. SUCH POLICING INCREASES THE FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES IN THE GROUP AND ENHANCES GROUP COHESION. THE SURPRISING ASPECT OF THIS THEORY IS THAT LOW RELATEDNESS IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO THE SPREAD OF POLICING TRAITS THAN IS HIGH RELATEDNESS. HERE A NEW EXPLANATION IS DEVELOPED OF THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT FAVOUR POLICING. THE MODEL IS THEN EXTENDED IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, MORE REALISM IS ADDED TO THE THEORY BY ACCOUNTING FOR THE FULL RANGE OF COSTS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPETITIVE AND COOPERATIVE TRAITS WITHIN GROUPS. SECOND, ANOTHER SURPRISING RESULT IS INTRODUCED ABOUT COOPERATIVE EVOLUTION. SMALL VARIATIONS IN INDIVIDUAL VIGOUR OR RESOURCES CAN LEAD TO LARGE VARIATIONS IN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLICING THE GROUP.

HOWEVER, RECIPROCITY IS JUST ONE WAY OF GETTING A RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT IN ALTRUISM AND IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO MANY EXAMPLES. RECIPROCITY THEORY ADDRESSES HOW ANIMALS RESPOND DYNAMICALLY TO OTHERS SO AS TO COOPERATE WITHOUT BEING EXPLOITED. I DISCUSS HOW INTRODUCING DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUAL GENEROSITY TOGETHER WITH PARTNER CHOICE INTO MODELS OF RECIPROCITY CAN LEAD TO AN ESCALATION IN ALTRUISTIC BEHAVIOUR. INDIVIDUALS MAY COMPETE FOR THE MOST ALTRUISTIC PARTNERS AND NON-ALTRUISTS MAY BECOME OSTRACIZED. I REFER TO THIS PHENOMENON AS COMPETITIVE ALTRUISM AND PROPOSE THAT IT CAN REPRESENT A MOVE AWAY FROM THE DYNAMIC RESPONSIVENESS OF RECIPROCITY. ALTRUISM MAY BE REWARDED IN KIND, BUT REWARDS MAY BE INDIRECTLY ACCRUED OR MAY NOT INVOLVE THE RETURN OF ALTRUISM AT ALL, FOR EXAMPLE IF ALTRUISTS TEND TO BE CHOSEN AS MATES. THIS VARIETY MAKES THE IDEA OF COMPETITIVE ALTRUISM RELEVANT TO BEHAVIOURS WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY RECIPROCITY. I CONSIDER WHETHER ALTRUISM MIGHT ACT AS A SIGNAL OF QUALITY, AS PROPOSED BY THE HANDICAP PRINCIPLE. I SUGGEST THAT ALTRUISTIC ACTS COULD MAKE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE SIGNALS BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT BENEFITS TO RECEIVERS. I CONSIDER HOW RECIPROCITY AND COMPETITIVE ALTRUISM ARE RELATED AND HOW THEY MAY BE DISTINGUISHED.","UNIV NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, DEPT PSYCHOL, EVOLUT & BEHAV RES GRP, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.;","10.1098/rspb.1998.0312","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1394","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","PROC.

PROTECTIVE TRAITS MAY BE INDUCED UPON EXPOSURE TO PREDATORS OR PARASITES. IN A SIMILAR WAY, HUMANS VACCINATE IN RESPONSE TO THREATENING EPIDEMICS. WHEN MOST GROUP MEMBERS DEFEND THEMSELVES, EPIDEMICS DIE OUT QUICKLY BECAUSE PARASITES CANNOT SPREAD. A HIGH LEVEL OF GROUP (HERD) IMMUNITY IS THEREFORE BENEFICIAL TO THE GROUP. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A WELL-KNOWN DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE OPTIMUM DEGREE OF INDUCTION FOR SELFISH INDIVIDUALS AND THE LEVEL OF INDUCTION THAT MAXIMIZES GROUP BENEFIT. I DEVELOP TWO OPTIMALITY MODELS FOR THE FREQUENCY OF INDUCTION. THE FIRST MODEL SHOWS THAT HIGHER RELATEDNESS FAVOURS MORE INDUCTION AND A SMALLER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELFISH AND COOPERATIVE OPTIMA. THE SECOND MODEL ASSUMES VARIATION IN THE VIGOUR OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEREFORE DIFFERENCES IN THE RELATIVE COST FOR INDUCTION. THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT STRONG INDIVIDUALS INDUCE MORE EASILY THAN WEAK INDIVIDUALS. SMALL DIFFERENCES IN VIGOUR CAUSE A LARGE DIVERGENCE IN THE OPTIMAL LEVELS OF INDUCTION FOR STRONG AND WEAK INDIVIDUALS. THE CONCEPT OF GENETIC RELATEDNESS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY MODEL IS ANALOGOUS TO CORRELATED INTERESTS AND CORRELATED STRATEGIES IN AN ECONOMIC MODEL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOUR. THE EVOLUTIONARY MODELS PRESENTED HERE THEREFORE PROVIDE A BASIS FOR FURTHER STUDY OF HUMAN VACCINATION.","UNIV CALIF IRVINE, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, IRVINE, CA 92697 USA.;","10.1098/rspb.1998.0519","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1408","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","PROC.

IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY CONFLICT MEDIATION, THE PROCESS BY WHICH GENETIC MODIFIERS EVOLVE THAT ENHANCE COOPERATION BY ALTERING THE PARAMETERS OF DEVELOPMENT OR RULES OF FORMATION OF CELL GROUPS. WE ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THESE MODIFIERS LEAD TO A NEW HIGHER-LEVEL UNIT OF SELECTION WITH INCREASED COOPERATION AMONG GROUP MEMBERS AND HERITABLE VARIATION IN FITNESS AT THE GROUP LEVEL. BY SCULPTING THE FITNESS VARIATION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR SELECTION AT THE TWO LEVELS, CONFLICT MODIFIERS CREATE NEW FUNCTIONS AT THE ORGANISM LEVEL. AN ORGANISM IS MORE THAN A GROUP OF COOPERATING CELLS RELATED BY COMMON DESCENT; ORGANISMS REQUIRE ADAPTATIONS THAT REGULATE CONFLICT WITHIN. OTHERWISE THEIR CONTINUED EVOLUTION IS FRUSTRATED BY THE: CREATION OF WITHIN-ORGANISM VARIATION AND CONFLICT BETWEEN LEVELS OF SELECTION. THE EVOLUTION OF CONFLICT MODIFIERS IS A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO THE EMERGENCE OF INDIVIDUALITY AND THE CONTINUED WELL BEING OF THE ORGANISM.

WE FOLLOWED INDIVIDUALS OF LONGNOSED PARROTFISH, HIPPOSCARUS HARID, FOR UP TO 120 MIN IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND NOTED THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH CLEANER WRASSES, LABROIDES DIMIDIATUS. INDIVIDUALS WERE LIKELY TO RETURN TO THE SAME CLEANING STATION IF THE PREVIOUS INTERACTION HAD ENDED WITHOUT CONFLICT BUT CHANGED CLEANERS FOR THE NEXT INSPECTION IF THEY HAD BEEN EITHER CHEATED OR IGNORED, AT LEAST IF THE TIME BETWEEN TWO CONSECUTIVE VISITS WAS SHORT. THE OVERALL ATTRACTIVENESS OF A CLEANING STATION SEEMED TO BE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF SERVICE QUALITY, WHICH APPEARED TO BE SIMILAR AT ALL STATIONS.

DURING AN EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITION, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM SINGLE CELLS TO MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS, THE NEW HIGHER-LEVEL EVOLUTIONARY UNIT (MULTICELLULAR ORGANISM) GAINS ITS EMERGENT PROPERTIES BY VIRTUE OF THE INTERACTIONS AMONG LOWER-LEVEL UNITS (CELLS). WE SEE THE FORMATION OF COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG LOWER-LEVEL UNITS AS A NECESSARY STEP IN EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITIONS; ONLY COOPERATION TRANSFERS FITNESS FROM LOWER LEVELS (COSTS TO GROUP MEMBERS) TO HIGHER LEVELS (BENEFITS TO THE GROUP). AS COOPERATION CREATES NEW LEVELS OF FITNESS, IT CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONFLICT BETWEEN LEVELS AS DELETERIOUS MUTANTS ARISE AND SPREAD WITHIN THE GROUP. FUNDAMENTAL TO THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW HIGHER-LEVEL UNIT IS THE MEDIATION OF CONFLICT AMONG LOWER-LEVEL UNITS IN FAVOR OF THE HIGHER-LEVEL UNIT. THE ACQUISITION OF HERITABLE VARIATION IN FITNESS AT THE NEW LEVEL, VIA CONFLICT MEDIATION, REQUIRES THE REORGANIZATION OF THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF FITNESS (SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION) AND LIFE-PROPERTIES (SUCH AS IMMORTALITY AND TOTIPOTENCY) AS WELL AS THE CO-OPTION OF LOWER-LEVEL PROCESSES FOR NEW FUNCTIONS AT THE HIGHER LEVEL. THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONFLICTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION IN INDIVIDUALITY HAVE BEEN MEDIATED, AND FITNESS AND GENERAL LIFE-TRAITS HAVE BEEN RE-ORGANIZED, CAN INFLUENCE THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER EVOLUTION (I.E., EVOLVABILITY) OF THE NEWLY EMERGED EVOLUTIONARY INDIVIDUAL. WE USE THE VOLVOCALEAN GREEN ALGAL GROUP AS A MODEL-SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITIONS IN INDIVIDUALITY AND TO APPLY AND TEST THE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES PRESENTED ABOVE. LASTLY, WE DISCUSS HOW THE DIFFERENT NOTIONS OF INDIVIDUALITY STEM FROM THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF FITNESS IN A MULTILEVEL SELECTION CONTEXT.","UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.;","10.1093/icb/43.1.64","ARTICLE; PROCEEDINGS PAPER",NA,NA,"1","INTEGR COMP BIOL","INTEGR.

THEIR AGGREGATION PHEROMONES ATTRACT BOTH SEXES AND ARE ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME CONSTITUTIVE AND RAPIDLY INDUCIBLE LETHAL DEFENSES. THE RELATIVE BENEFITS TO SENDERS VERSUS RECEIVERS OF THESE SIGNALS ARE ONLY PARTLY UNDERSTOOD. BECAUSE THE INITIAL STAGE OF HOST ENTRY CAN BE HAZARDOUS, THERE MAY BE BENEFIT TO A CHEATING STRATEGY, WHOSE PRACTITIONERS RESPOND TO PHEROMONES BUT DO NOT ENGAGE IN HOST SEARCHING. SEVERAL DISADVANTAGES TO CHEATING HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, BUT THE ROLE OF PREDATORS HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED. PREDATORS EXPLOIT BARK BEETLE PHEROMONES TO LOCATE PREY, ACCUMULATE AT THE BREEDING SITE, AND CONSUME ADULT BARK BEETLES BEFORE THEY ENTER THE TREE. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS QUANTIFIED ARRIVAL PATTERNS IN THE FIELD. WE USED A LABORATORY ASSAY TO INVESTIGATE RELATIVE PREDATION ON PIONEERS (THOSE THAT INITIALLY SELECT AND ENTER HOSTS) AND RESPONDERS (THOSE THAT ARRIVE AT A HOST IN RESPONSE TO PHEROMONES) DURING HOST COLONIZATION. OUR MODEL SYSTEM UTILIZED THE PINE ENGRAVER, IPS PINI, WHICH EXHIBITS MALE HAREM POLYGAMY. WE ALLOWED MALE I. PINI TO COLONIZE HOST TISSUE AND ADDED FEMALES 1 DAY LATER. ALSO 1 DAY LATER, WE VARIABLY ADDED ADDITIONAL MALES AND PREDACIOUS CHECKERED BEETLES, THANASIMUS DUBIUS. THESE TREATMENTS INCLUDED TWO DENSITIES OF MALES AND THREE DENSITIES OF PREDATORS THAT WERE SELECTED TO EMULATE FIELD CONDITIONS. RESPONDING MALES EXPERIENCED HIGHER PREDATION THAN PIONEERS. T.

THUS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE INTERACTIONS AMONG PLANTS, MUTUALISTS, AND OTHER SELECTIVE AGENTS, SUCH AS ANTAGONISTS, ULTIMATELY SHAPE THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL AND FLOWERING TRAITS. WE EXAMINED THE IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATION VS PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION TO SELECTION ON PLANT AND FLORAL CHARACTERS VIA FEMALE PLANT-REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN CASTILLEJA LINARIAEFOLIA (SCROPHULARIACEAE). C. LINARIAEFOLIA IS POLLINATED BY HUMMINGBIRDS AND EXPERIENCES HIGH LEVELS OF PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION BY PLUME MOTH AND FLY LARVAE IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO, USA, WHERE THIS WORK WAS CONDUCTED. WE FIRST EXAMINED WHETHER FEMALE REPRODUCTION IN C. LINARIAEFOLIA WAS LIMITED BY POLLINATION. SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION ONLY MARGINALLY INCREASED COMPONENTS OF FEMALE REPRODUCTION, LIKELY BECAUSE SEED PREDATION MASKED, IN PART, THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF POLLEN ADDITION. IN UNMANIPULATED POPULATIONS, WE MEASURED CALYX LENGTH, FLOWER PRODUCTION, AND PLANT HEIGHT AND USED PATH ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING TO QUANTIFY THEIR IMPORTANCE TO RELATIVE SEED SET THROUGH PATHWAYS INVOLVING POLLINATION VS SEED PREDATION. WE FOUND THAT THE STRENGTH OF SELECTION ON CALYX LENGTH, FLOWER PRODUCTION, AND PLANT HEIGHT WAS GREATER FOR SEED PREDATION PATHWAYS THAN FOR POLLINATION PATHWAYS, AND ONE CHARACTER, CALYX LENGTH, EXPERIENCED OPPOSING SELECTION VIA POLLINATION VS SEED PREDATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE REMARKABLE INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN PLANT AND FLORAL CHARACTERS EXHIBITED BY SOME FLOWERING PLANTS IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF SELECTION DRIVEN, AT LEAST IN PART, BY POLLINATORS IN CONCERT WITH ANTAGONISTS, SUCH AS PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS.

IN THIS REVIEW I DESCRIBE KNOWN AND LESS WELL-KNOWN PROXIMATE ASPECTS OF COOPERATION AND CONFLICT OVER REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR IN SOCIAL ANIMALS, WHERE INDIVIDUALS OTHER THAN THE GENETIC PARENTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROVISIONING OF CARE ('ALLOPARENTAL CARE'). TRADITIONALLY THE EVOLUTION OF ALLOPARENTAL CARE IS VIEWED AS A TWO-STEP PROCESS: THE DECISION TO DELAY DISPERSAL AND INDEPENDENT BREEDING, USUALLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF CONSTRAINTS ON INDEPENDENT BREEDING, AND THE DECISION TO BEHAVE AS ALLOPARENTS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE DELAYED DISPERSAL GAIN A NET FITNESS BENEFIT. BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGICAL THEORY GENERALLY ASSUMES THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE SIMILAR IN 'MAKE-UP' AND THAT LIFE HISTORY AND BEHAVIOURAL DECISIONS ARE FACULTATIVE. HOWEVER, THERE IS PROBABLY MORE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. HERE, I DEMONSTRATE THAT SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOURS ARE BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, WHICH MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH 'REACTION NORMS' OR THE GENOTYPE'S QUANTITATIVE PHENOTYPIC VARIATION, OR WHICH MAY YIELD POLYETHISMS. MOST EVOLUTIONARY MODELS OF ANIMAL COOPERATION ARE BASED ON OPTIMALITY APPROACHES THAT DO NOT CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL GENETIC VARIATION AND MATERNAL EFFECTS ON THE VARIATION IN THE EXPRESSION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE GENETIC BASIS OF COOPERATIONS AND SUBORDINATE-BREEDER INTERACTIONS MAY BE CRUCIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. IF WE TAKE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES INTO ACCOUNT OUR CONCLUSIONS AND EXPLANATIONS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR MAY CHANGE. GIVEN THE CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS RESEARCH DISCIPLINES ADDRESSING DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOPERATION AND CONFLICT OVER INVESTMENT, THE ISSUES DESCRIBED HERE SHOULD LEAD TO MORE MUTUAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES AND STIMULATE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF COOPERATION STRATEGIES IN GENERAL.","UNIV GRONINGEN, CTR ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES, ANIM ECOL GRP, NL-9750 AA HAREN, NETHERLANDS.;","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01243.x","REVIEW",NA,NA,"8","ETHOLOGY","ETHOLOGY","ENGLISH",2006,"KOMDEUR, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GRONINGEN, CTR ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES, ANIM ECOL GRP, POB 14, NL-9750 AA HAREN, NETHERLANDS.","ETHOLOGY",58,"VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AMONG SOCIAL ANIMALS","WOS:000239004200001","112","ISI","UNIV GRONINGEN","UNIV GRONINGEN",NA,"KOMDEUR J, 2006, ETHOLOGY","KOMDEUR J, 2006, ETHOLOGY"

HOW IS COOPERATION MAINTAINED IN THE FACE OF SELECTION FOR SELFISHNESS AND CHEATING? BOTH THEORY AND DATA SUGGEST THAT PARTNER CHOICE, WHERE ONE SPECIES PREFERENTIALLY DIRECTS AID TO THE MORE COOPERATIVE MEMBERS OF THE OTHER SPECIES, IS CENTRAL TO COOPERATION IN MANY MUTUALISMS. HOWEVER, THE THEORY HAS ONLY SO FAR CONSIDERED THE EVOLUTIONARY EFFECTS OF PARTNER CHOICE ON ONE OF THE SPECIES IN A MUTUALISM IN ISOLATION. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE CO-EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION AND CHOICE IN A CHOOSY HOST AND ITS SYMBIONT. OUR MODEL REVEALS THAT EVEN THOUGH CHOICE AND COOPERATION MAY BE INITIALLY SELECTED, IT WILL OFTEN BE UNSTABLE. THIS IS BECAUSE CHOICE REDUCES VARIATION IN THE SYMBIONT AND, THEREFORE, TENDS TO REMOVE THE SELECTIVE INCENTIVE FOR ITS OWN MAINTENANCE (A SCENARIO PARALLELED IN THE LEK PARADOX IN FEMALE CHOICE AND POLICING IN WITHIN-SPECIES COOPERATION). HOWEVER, WE ALSO SHOW THAT WHEN VARIABILITY IS REINTRODUCED INTO SYMBIONTS EACH GENERATION, IN THE FORM OF LESS COOPERATIVE INDIVIDUALS, CHOICE IS MAINTAINED. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESENCE OF CHEATERS AND CHEATER SPECIES IN MANY MUTUALISMS IS CENTRAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF PARTNER CHOICE AND, PARADOXICALLY, COOPERATION ITSELF.","UNIV HELSINKI, DEPT BIOL & ENVIRONM SCI, LAB ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY DYNAM, HELSINKI 00014, FINLAND.;","10.1098/rspb.2006.3571","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1598","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","PROC.

BURROW AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO FOSSORIAL ANIMALS. THE SOUTHERN HAIRY-NOSED WOMBAT (LASIORHINUS LATIFRONS) BURROWS IN BOTH HARD AND FRIABLE SOILS. THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE HARDER SUBSTRATE SHOULD PROMOTE CLOSER GEOGRAPHICAL CLUSTERING OF BURROWS THAN IN SOFTER SOILS. CLUSTERED BURROWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LARGER GROUP SIZES. IF SOCIALITY IS DRIVEN BY CONSTRAINT RATHER THAN ADVANTAGE, PATTERNS OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMALS WITHIN AND AMONG GROUPS MAY SHOW INDICATIONS OF AVOIDANCE OR EVEN ANTAGONISM, AND 'MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD JOB' VIA POSITIVE KIN ASSOCIATIONS TO OFFSET THE DISADVANTAGES OF HIGH-DENSITY LIVING. TO TEST THESE IDEAS, WE COMPARED WARREN RELATEDNESS AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF L. LATIFRONS ON FRIABLE SOILS (NULLARBOR PLAIN) AND HARD CALCRETE (BROOKFIELD CONSERVATION PARK, BCP). INDIVIDUALS WERE SAMPLED BY NONINVASIVE COLLECTION OF HAIRS FOR GENOTYPING TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS AND TO ESTIMATE THEIR SPACE-USE AND ASSOCIATIVE BEHAVIOUR WITH RESPECT TO RELATEDNESS. BURROWS IN CALCRETE WERE INDEED MORE CLUMPED, AND WARREN AND GROUP SIZE LARGER. DIFFERENCES IN SPATIOTEMPORAL ORGANIZATION AND RELATEDNESS STRUCTURE BETWEEN SITES WERE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION: (I) NULLARBOR MALES ASSOCIATED AND SHARED WARRENS LESS THAN AT BCP; AND (II) NULLARBOR SPATIAL RELATEDNESS PATTERNING DATA WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSED FEMALE BREEDING DISPERSAL, IN CONTRAST TO THOSE AT BCP. UNDER NULLARBOR (LOW DENSITY) CONDITIONS, COOPERATION OR TOLERANCE BETWEEN MALES MAY BE LESS ADVANTAGEOUS, AND ACCESSING OR DIGGING BURROWS SHOULD BE LESS OF A CONSTRAINT FOR JUVENILE FEMALES.","MONASH UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, AUSTRALIAN CTR BIODIVERS ANAL CONSERVAT & MANAGEM, CLAYTON, VIC 3800, AUSTRALIA.;","10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03131.x","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1","MOL ECOL","MOL.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE THREAT OF TERMINATING AN ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER, DEPENDS UPON THE EASE WITH WHICH BOTH THE POTENTIAL VICTIM AND THE POTENTIAL EXPLOITER CAN FIND REPLACEMENT PARTNERS. HERE, WE EXTEND A SIMPLE, GAME-THEORETICAL MODEL OF THIS FORM OF PARTNER CONTROL TO INCORPORATE VARIATION IN THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND EXPLOITERS, WHICH LEADS TO VARIATION IN THE TIME REQUIRED FOR INDIVIDUALS OF EACH TYPE TO FIND A NEW PARTNER. WE SHOW THAT SUCH MARKET EFFECTS HAVE A DRAMATIC INFLUENCE ON THE STABLE LEVEL OF EXPLOITATION (AND CONSEQUENT DURATION OF INTERACTION). AS THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF VICTIMS DECREASES, THEY BECOME LESS TOLERANT TO EXPLOITATION, TERMINATING ENCOUNTERS EARLIER (FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF EXPLOITATION), WHEREAS EXPLOITERS BEHAVE IN A MORE COOPERATIVE MANNER. AS A RESULT, THE STABLE DURATION OF INTERACTION ACTUALLY INCREASES, DESPITE THE DECREASING TOLERANCE OF THE VICTIMS.

HERE, I INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PUPS AND HELPERS IN THE COMMUNALLY BREEDING BANDED MONGOOSE (MUNGOS MUNGO), WHERE EACH PUP FORMS AN EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH A SINGLE ADULT HELPER (TERMED ITS 'ESCORT'). BY EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATING PUP NEED, I DEMONSTRATE THAT CHANGES IN BEGGING RATE CORRESPOND TO CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM NEED. THE DATA THEN SUGGEST THAT ESCORTS IN GOOD CONDITION MAY BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO INCREASED BEGGING AND THAT PUPS ASSOCIATING WITH THEM INCREASE THEIR BEGGING MORE THAN DO PUPS PAIRED WITH ESCORTS IN POOR CONDITION. ESCORTS ALSO APPEAR MORE RESPONSIVE TO INCREASED BEGGING BY FEMALE PUPS, AND FEMALE PUPS INCREASE THEIR BEGGING MORE THAN DO MALE PUPS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BANDED MONGOOSE PUPS MAY STRATEGICALLY ADJUST THEIR INVESTMENT IN BEGGING IN RELATION TO VARIATION IN THE EXPECTED PAY-OFF. I ARGUE THAT SUCH ADJUSTMENT IS LIKELY TO BE A GENERAL PHENOMENON: WHEREVER THERE IS VARIATION IN RESPONSIVENESS TO SIGNALS, SIGNALLERS WILL BE SELECTED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF RECEIVER AND ADJUST THEIR SIGNALS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE PAY-OFFS. THEREFORE, DIFFERENCES IN SIGNAL INTENSITY MAY BE AS MUCH A PRODUCT OF CONTEXT AS AN INDICATION OF VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL PHENOTYPIC OR GENOTYPIC STATE.","UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT ZOOL, LARGE ANIM RES GRP, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EJ, ENGLAND.;","10.1098/rspb.2008.0173","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1640","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","PROC.

EXAMINE HOW SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE (SNS) MIGHT INFLUENCE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS IN NON-HUMAN ANIMALS. HERE, WE PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF WHY AND HOW THE SOCIAL NETWORK APPROACH MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY. WE FIRST NOTE FOUR IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF SNS THAT ARE COMMONLY OBSERVED, BUT RELATIVELY RARELY QUANTIFIED: (1) THAT WITHIN A SOCIAL GROUP, DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR SOCIAL EXPERIENCES AND CONNECTIONS AFFECT INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP OUTCOMES; (2) THAT INDIRECT CONNECTIONS CAN BE IMPORTANT (E.G., PARTNERS OF YOUR PARTNERS MATTER); (3) THAT INDIVIDUALS DIFFER IN THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK (SOME CAN BE CONSIDERED KEYSTONE INDIVIDUALS); AND (4) THAT SOCIAL NETWORK TRAITS OFTEN CARRY OVER ACROSS CONTEXTS (E.G., SN POSITION IN MALE-MALE COMPETITION CAN INFLUENCE LATER MALE MATING SUCCESS). WE THEN DISCUSS HOW THESE FOUR POINTS, AND THE SOCIAL NETWORK APPROACH IN GENERAL, CAN YIELD NEW INSIGHTS AND QUESTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES IN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY INCLUDING: MATE CHOICE, ALTERNATIVE MATING TACTICS, MALE-MALE COMPETITION, COOPERATION, RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM, EAVESDROPPING, KIN SELECTION, DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES, SOCIAL LEARNING, INFORMATION FLOW, SOCIAL FORAGING, AND COOPERATIVE ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR. FINALLY, WE SUGGEST FUTURE DIRECTIONS INCLUDING: (1) INTEGRATING BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES AND SNT; (2) COMPARING SPACE USE AND SNS; (3) ADAPTIVE PARTNER CHOICE AND SNS; (4) THE DYNAMICS AND STABILITY (OR INSTABILITY) OF SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND (5) GROUP SELECTION SHAPING SNS.","[SIH, ANDREW] UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT ENVIRONM SCI & POLICY, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.; [HANSER, SEAN F.;] UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT VET MED POPULAT HLTH & REPROD, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.; [MCHUGH, KATHERINE A.;] UNIV CALIF DAVIS, ANIM BEHAV GRAD GRP, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.;","10.1007/s00265-009-0725-6","REVIEW","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [0078033, 0222063]","THIS PAPER EMERGED FROM A WORKSHOP ON SOCIAL NETWORK THEORY FUNDED LARGELY BY THE ANIMAL BEHAVIOR GRADUATE GROUP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS.

THE HUGE DIVERSITY OF SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS AMONG ANIMALS AND/OR PLANTS COMPRISES BOTH MUTUALISMS AND PARASITISMS. MOST SYMBIOSES BETWEEN SOCIAL INSECT SPECIES, HOWEVER, INVOLVE SOCIAL PARASITES, WHILE MUTUAL BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ONLY SUSPECTED FOR SOME PARABIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS - TWO COLONIES THAT SHARE A NEST. 2. IN THE RAINFOREST OF BORNEO, WE STUDIED PARABIOTIC ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE ANTS CREMATOGASTER MODIGLIANII AND CAMPONOTUS RUFIFEMUR. PARABIOTIC NESTS WERE REGULARLY FOUND INSIDE HOLLOW TREE TRUNKS, MOST LIKELY INITIATED BY CR. MODIGLIANII. THIS SPECIES FREQUENTLY NESTED WITHOUT ITS PARTNER, WHEREAS WE NEVER FOUND NON-PARABIOTIC CA. RUFIFEMUR NESTS. WE EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATED POTENTIAL BENEFITS, POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE COMPETITION FOR FOOD (AS A PROBABLE COST), AND FORAGING NICHES OF BOTH SPECIES. 3. THE TWO SPECIES NEVER SHOWED AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS AND AMICABLY SHARED FOOD RESOURCES. HOWEVER, CR. MODIGLIANII HAD A WIDER TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL FORAGING RANGE THAN CA. RUFIFEMUR, ALWAYS FOUND BAITS BEFORE CA. RUFIFEMUR AND RECRUITED MORE EFFICIENTLY. CAMPONOTUS RUFIFEMUR PROBABLY BENEFITED FROM FOLLOWING PHEROMONE TRAILS OF CR. MODIGLIANII. IN TURN, CA. RUFIFEMUR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THE NEST AGAINST ALIEN ANTS. CREMATOGASTER MODIGLIANII HENCE MAY PROFIT FROM ITS PARTNER'S DEFENSIVE ABILITIES. 4. IN NEOTROPICAL PARABIOSES, EPIPHYTES GROWN IN 'ANT-GARDENS' PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE ASSOCIATION, E.G. BY STABILIZATION OF NESTS. HEMIEPIPHYTIC POIKILOSPERMUM CORDIFOLIUM (CECROPIACEAE) SEEDLINGS AND SAPLINGS FREQUENTLY GREW IN THE ENTRANCES OF PARABIOTIC NESTS IN BORNEO, OBVIOUSLY DISPERSED BY THE ANTS. IN CAFETERIA EXPERIMENTS, BOTH PARABIOTIC ANTS CARRIED ITS ELAIOSOME-BEARING SEEDS INTO THE NEST. HOWEVER, P. CORDIFOLIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NEST SPACE, CONTRASTING WITH NEOTROPICAL ANT-GARDENS. 5.

WE EXAMINED CONSEQUENCES OF VARIATION IN SEXUAL CONFLICT IN TWO CLOSELY-RELATED PASSERINE BIRDS WITH CONTRASTING BREEDING SYSTEMS: THE EURASIAN PENDULINE TIT REMIZ PENDULINUS (EPT) EXHIBITING A HIGHLY POLYGAMOUS BREEDING SYSTEM WITH SEXUALLY ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS OVER PARENTAL CARE, AND THE SOCIALLY MONOGAMOUS CAPE PENDULINE TIT ANTHOSCOPUS MINUTUS (CPT). WE DERIVED FOUR A PRIORI PREDICTIONS FROM SEXUAL CONFLICT THEORY AND TESTED THESE USING DATA COLLECTED IN CENTRAL EUROPE (EPT) AND SOUTH AFRICA (CPT). FIRSTLY, WE PREDICTED THAT EPTS EXHIBIT MORE SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC PLUMAGE THAN CPTS DUE TO MORE INTENSE SEXUAL SELECTION. SECONDLY, WE EXPECTED BRIGHTER EPT MALES TO PROVIDE LESS CARE THAN DULLER MALES. THIRDLY, SINCE SONG IS A SEXUALLY SELECTED TRAIT IN MANY BIRDS, MALE EPTS WERE EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT MORE COMPLEX SONGS THAN CPT MALES. FINALLY, INTENSE SEXUAL CONFLICT IN EPT WAS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO LOW NEST ATTENDANCE AS AN INDICATION OF SEXUALLY ANTAGONISTIC INTERESTS, WHEREAS WE EXPECTED MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN PARENTS IN CPT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR SOCIALLY MONOGAMOUS BREEDING SYSTEM. RESULTS: CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREDICTIONS EPTS EXHIBITED GREATER SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN PLUMAGE AND MORE COMPLEX SONG THAN CPTS, AND BRIGHTER EPT MALES PROVIDED LESS CARE THAN DULLER ONES. EPT PARENTS ATTENDED THE NEST LESS FREQUENTLY AND LESS SIMULTANEOUSLY THAN CPT PARENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SEXUAL CONFLICT THEORY: SPECIES IN WHICH SEXUAL CONFLICT IS MORE MANIFESTED (EPT) EXHIBITED A STRONGER SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND MORE ELABORATED SEXUALLY SELECTED TRAITS THAN SPECIES WITH LESS INTENSE SEXUAL CONFLICT (CPT). OUR RESULTS ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT EPTS ATTEMPT TO FORCE THEIR PARTNER TO WORK HARDER AS EXPECTED UNDER SEXUAL CONFLICT: EACH MEMBER OF THE BREEDING PAIR ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT THE COSTS OF CARE TO THE OTHER PARENT. MORE BRIGHTLY COLORED MALES BENEFIT MORE FROM DESERTION THAN DULL ONES, BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMATE WITH A NEW FEMALE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE COMPARISON BETWEEN TWO CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES WITH CONTRASTING BREEDING SYSTEMS SUGGEST THAT SEXUAL CONFLICT OVER CARE HAS INFLUENCED THE EVOLUTION OF BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGY IN PENDULINE TITS.","[VAN DIJK, RENE E.;; SZEKELY, TAMAS] UNIV BATH, DEPT BIOL & BIOCHEM, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND.; [VAN DIJK, RENE E.;; KOMDEUR, JAN] UNIV GRONINGEN, ANIM ECOL GRP, CTR ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES, CTR BIOL, NL-9750 AA HAREN, NETHERLANDS.; [VAN DIJK, RENE E.;] UNIV SHEFFIELD, DEPT ANIM & PLANT SCI, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.; [KOMDEUR, JAN] EOTVOS LORAND UNIV, GOD BIOL CTR, H-2131 GOD, HUNGARY.; [LLOYD, PENN] UNIV CAPE TOWN, PERCY FITZPATRICK INST, DST NRF CTR EXCELLENCE, ZA-7701 CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.;","10.1186/1471-2148-10-107","ARTICLE",NA,NA,NA,"BMC EVOL BIOL","BMC EVOL.

SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IS LIKELY TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE, RESULTING IN DIFFERENT SOCIAL ROLES AT DIFFERENT AGES. INDIVIDUALS MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO INTERACT DIFFERENTLY WITH OTHERS BASED ON THEIR AGE, SEX OR KINSHIP. WE USED SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE BIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL VARIATION IN FREE-LIVING GROUPS OF YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS, MARMOTA FLAVIVENTRIS. TO MEASURE SOCIAL VARIATION, WE CHOSE NETWORK MEASURES THAT REFLECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S TENDENCY TO INITIATE OR RECEIVE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTERACTIONS. WE ASKED HOW AGE, SEX AND KINSHIP INFLUENCED PATTERNS OF AFFILIATIVE ( SOCIALLY COHESIVE) AND AGONISTIC ( SOCIALLY COMPETITIVE) INTERACTIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PREDICTED THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD VARY IN THEIR TENDENCY TO INITIATE AND RECEIVE INTERACTIONS ACCORDING TO THESE CHARACTERISTICS, AND THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO INTERACT AFFILIATIVELY WITH MORE SIMILAR INDIVIDUALS AND TO INTERACT AGONISTICALLY WITH MORE DISSIMILAR INDIVIDUALS. WE FOUND THAT PATTERNS OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT INTERACTIONS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH AGE, WITH YOUNGER ANIMALS BEING MORE INVOLVED IN AFFILIATIVE INTERACTIONS AND OLDER ANIMALS INITIATING MORE AGONISTIC ONES. FURTHERMORE, AFFILIATIVE NETWORKS TENDED TO BE STRUCTURED BY AGE AND KINSHIP. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YEARLING YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING SOCIAL COHESION THAN HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECOGNIZED, AND THAT MARMOT COLONIES ARE LARGELY ORGANIZED BASED ON AGE GROUP AND KINSHIP.

THIS NEED NOT BE TRUE. AS WE DEMONSTRATE, DIFFERENCES ARE NOT INNOCUOUS NOISE, BUT CAN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF A GAME. EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF VARIABILITY CAN STABILIZE COOPERATION BY, FOR EXAMPLE, MAINTAINING THE NEED TO DEAL WITH CHEATERS. DIFFERENCES PROMOTE THE NEED TO LEARN ABOUT OTHERS IN AN INTERACTION, LEADING TO CONTINGENT BEHAVIOUR THAT CAN REDUCE CONFLICT, AND TO NEGOTIATED OUTCOMES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE MORE COOPERATIVE THAN UNCONDITIONAL ACTIONS. ONCE THERE ARE MECHANISMS SUCH AS MUTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES THAT MAINTAIN VARIATION WITHIN POPULATIONS, WHETHER COOPERATION EVOLVES MAY DEPEND ON THE VARIATION IN THE COOPERATIVENESS TRAIT. VARIATION MEANS THAT IT MAY BE WORTH TAKING A CHANCE THAT A PARTNER IS COOPERATIVE BY BEING COOPERATIVE. WHEN THERE ARE MARKETS, SO THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BREAK OFF INTERACTIONS TO SEEK A BETTER PARTNER, VARIATION PROMOTES CHOOSINESS AND HENCE PENALIZES THOSE UNCOOPERATIVE INDIVIDUALS, WHO ARE REJECTED.

HOWEVER, FOCUSING ON UNGULATES, I HERE REVIEW INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUALLY SELECTED ADAPTATIONS REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF SEX ROLES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO FEMALE BEHAVIOUR. I SHOW HOW MATE COMPETITION AND MATE CHOICE IN BOTH SEXES CAN INTERACT AND OFTEN LEAD TO INTRA- AND INTERSEXUAL CONFLICTS AND SOMETIMES ALSO COOPERATION. BY CAUSING PHENOTYPIC SELECTION, THESE BEHAVIOURAL INTERACTIONS CAN SHAPE EVOLUTION ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME DEPENDS ON GENETIC CONSTRAINTS. I CONCLUDE THAT TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF MAMMALIAN MATING SYSTEMS WE MUST BROADEN OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FROM BEING LARGELY FOCUSED ON MALE COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES TO ENCOMPASS COEVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE MATING STRATEGIES OF BOTH SEXES.

WITH REGARDS TO HUMANS, HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE; IN PARTICULAR, HUMANS SOMETIMES EXHIBIT A DISCRIMINATE SOCIALITY ON THE BASIS OF CULTURALLY TRANSMITTED TRAITS, SUCH AS PERSONAL ORNAMENTS, LANGUAGES, RITUALS, ETC. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE HUMAN FACULTY OF CULTURAL TRANSMISSION AND RESULTANT CULTURAL VARIATION AMONG INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE FACILITATED THE EVOLUTION OF DISCRIMINATE SOCIALITY IN HUMANS. TO THIS END, A GENE-CULTURE COEVOLUTIONARY MODEL IS DEVELOPED FOCUSING ON COMPETITION OVER CONTROL OF RESOURCE AS A CONTEXT IN WHICH DISCRIMINATE SOCIALITY MAY HAVE EVOLVED. SPECIFICALLY, TWO TYPES OF CULTURE-DEPENDENT DISCRIMINATE SOCIALITY ARE CONSIDERED: INGROUP FAVOURITISM, WITH INGROUP AND OUTGROUP BEING DISTINGUISHED BY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A CULTURAL TRAIT; AND PRESTIGE HIERARCHIES, WITH THE PRESTIGE BEING CONFERRED ON THE BEARER OF A CULTURAL TRAIT. THE MODEL SPECIFIES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EMERGENCE AND EVOLUTIONARY STABILITY OF THE TWO TYPES OF DISCRIMINATE SOCIALITY ARE PROMOTED BY THE PRESENCE OF CULTURAL VARIATION AMONG INDIVIDUALS.","UNIV TOKYO, DEPT BIOL SCI, BUNKYO KU, TOKYO 1130033, JAPAN.;","10.1098/rstb.2010.0247","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"1566","PHILOS T R SOC B","PHILOS.

AS SUCH, MUTUALISM OPPOSES MECHANISMS OF KIN SELECTION AND TAG-BASED SELECTION (FOR EXAMPLE THE GREEN BEARD MECHANISM), WHICH ARE BASED ON GIVING EXCLUSIVE HELP TO PARTNERS THAT ARE RELATED OR CARRY THE SAME TAG. IN CONTRAST TO KIN SELECTION, WHICH IS A BASIS FOR PAROCHIALISM AND INTERGROUP WARFARE, MUTUALISM CAN THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS A MECHANISM THAT DRIVES PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS. HERE THE COMPETITION BETWEEN MUTUALISM AND KIN (TAG) SELECTION IS STUDIED. IN A MODEL WHERE KIN SELECTION AND TAG-BASED SELECTION ARE DOMINANT, MUTUALISM IS PROMOTED BY INTRODUCING ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS CAUSE REDUCTION IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BY THE MECHANISM OF VARIANCE DISCOUNT. THE BEST STRATEGY TO COUNTER VARIANCE DISCOUNT IS TO SHARE WITH AGENTS WHO EXPERIENCE THE MOST ANTICORRELATED FLUCTUATIONS, A STRATEGY CALLED BET HEDGING. IN THIS WAY, BET HEDGING STIMULATES COOPERATION WITH THE MOST UNRELATED PARTNERS, WHICH IS A BASIS FOR MUTUALISM. ANALYTIC RESULTS AND SIMULATIONS REVEAL THAT, IF THIS EFFECT IS LARGE ENOUGH, MUTUALISTIC STRATEGIES CAN DOMINATE KIN SELECTIVE STRATEGIES. IN ADDITION, MUTANTS OF THESE MUTUALISTIC STRATEGIES THAT EXPERIENCE FLUCTUATIONS THAT ARE MORE ANTICORRELATED TO THEIR PARTNER, CAN OUTCOMPETE WILD TYPE, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE EVOLUTION OF SPECIALIZATION. IN THIS WAY, THE EVOLUTIONARY SUCCESS OF MUTUALISTIC STRATEGIES CAN BE EXPLAINED BY BET HEDGING-BASED COOPERATION. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER LTD.

THIS VIEW HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE FINDING THAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT COOPERATIVELY PARTITION RESOURCES BY "" TAKING TURNS"". TURN-TAKING OCCURS WHEN TWO INDIVIDUALS COORDINATE THEIR AGONISTIC BEHAVIOUR IN A WAY THAT LEADS TO AN ALTERNATING PATTERN IN WHO OBTAINS A RESOURCE WITHOUT ENGAGING IN COSTLY FIGHTS. COOPERATIVE TURN-TAKING HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED IN MODELS OF ANIMAL CONFLICT AND SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL MODELS THAT EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS BASED ONLY ON CONTEST AND SCRAMBLE COMPETITION. CURRENTLY IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER TURN-TAKING SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL MODELS BECAUSE THE EVOLUTION OF TURN-TAKING IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER TURN-TAKING CAN EVOLVE WHEN FIGHTING COSTS AND ASSESSMENT OF FIGHTING ABILITIES ARE NOT FIXED BUT EMERGE FROM EVOLVED WITHIN-FIGHT BEHAVIOUR. WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WITH AN EVOLUTIONARY AGENT-BASED MODEL. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT TURN-TAKING EVOLVES FOR SMALL RESOURCE VALUES, ALONGSIDE A CONTEST STRATEGY THAT LEADS TO STABLE DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS. TURN-TAKING LEADS TO EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES WITH UNCLEAR DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS AND NON-LINEAR DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES. EVOLUTIONARY STABILITY OF TURN-TAKING EMERGED DESPITE STRENGTH DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND THE POSSIBILITY TO EVOLVE WITHIN-FIGHT BEHAVIOUR THAT ALLOWS GOOD ASSESSMENT OF FIGHTING ABILITIES. EVOLUTIONARY STABILITY EMERGED FROM FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT EFFECTS ON FITNESS, WHICH ARE MODULATED BY FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THE EVOLUTION OF WITHIN-FIGHT BEHAVIOUR AND THE EVOLUTION OF HIGHER-LEVEL CONFLICT STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS REVEAL THE IMPACT OF FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THE EVOLUTION OF WITHIN-FIGHT BEHAVIOUR AND THE EVOLUTION OF HIGHER-LEVEL CONFLICT STRATEGIES, SUCH AS TURN-TAKING. SIMILAR FEEDBACKS MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR THE EVOLUTION OF OTHER CONFLICT STRATEGIES SUCH AS WINNER-LOSER EFFECTS OR COALITIONS. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDY THAT INVESTIGATED SUCH FEEDBACKS. FURTHERMORE, OUR MODEL SUGGESTS THAT TURN-TAKING COULD BE USED BY ANIMALS TO PARTITION LOW VALUE RESOURCES, BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THIS HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED. THE EXISTENCE OF TURNTAKING MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED BECAUSE IT LEADS TO SOCIETIES WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO EMERGE FROM SCRAMBLE COMPETITION. ANALYSES OF TEMPORAL INTERACTION PATTERNS COULD BE USED TO TEST WHETHER TURN-TAKING OCCURS IN ANIMALS.","[FRANZ, MATHIAS; VAN DER POST, DANIEL; SCHUELKE, OLIVER; OSTNER, JULIA] UNIV GOTTINGEN, COURANT RES CTR EVOLUT SOCIAL BEHAV, D-37077 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.; [VAN DER POST, DANIEL] UNIV GRONINGEN, INST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NL-9700 AK GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.; [VAN DER POST, DANIEL] UNIV GRONINGEN, NL-9700 CC GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS.;","10.1186/1471-2148-11-323","ARTICLE","GERMAN EXCELLENCE INITIATIVE","WE THANK TWO ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS, ANNIE BISSONNETTE AND KAMILA FRANZ FOR HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS AND DISCUSSION.

WE FIRST REVIEW THE WAYS IN WHICH COMPETITION SHAPES THE ECOLOGY OF MUTUALISMS, USING A GRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON RESOURCE FLOWS RATHER THAN NET EFFECTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPETITION. WE THEN DESCRIBE THE KNOWN MECHANISMS OF COMPETITION AND SHOW HOW IT IS A CRITICAL DRIVER OF THE EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS, PERSISTENCE, AND DIVERSIFICATION OF MUTUALISM. WE ARGUE THAT EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH ON THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF MUTUALISMS WILL JOINTLY PROGRESS BY ADDRESSING FOUR KEY POINTS: (I) THE EXISTENCE AND SHAPE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL TRADE-OFFS AMONG COOPERATION, COMPETITION, AND OTHER LIFE-HISTORY AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; (II) THE CAPACITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO EXPRESS CONDITIONAL RESPONSES TO VARIATION IN THEIR MUTUALISTIC AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT; (III) THE EXISTENCE OF HERITABLE VARIATION FOR MUTUALISTIC AND COMPETITIVE TRAITS AND THEIR POTENTIALLY CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION; AND (IV) THE STRUCTURE OF THE NETWORK OF CONSUMER-RESOURCE INTERACTIONS IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE EMBEDDED.","[JONES, EMILY I.;] WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA.; [BRONSTEIN, JUDITH L.;; FERRIERE, REGIS] UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ USA.; [FERRIERE, REGIS] UPMC, ENS, CNRS, LAB ECOL & EVOLUT,UMR 7625, PARIS, FRANCE.;","10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06552.x","ARTICLE; BOOK CHAPTER",NA,NA,NA,"ANN NY ACAD SCI","ANN.NY ACAD.SCI.","ENGLISH",2012,"JONES, EI (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, POB 644236, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA.","YEAR IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",52,"THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF COMPETITION IN THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF MUTUALISMS","WOS:000305688600005","1256","ISI","WASHINGTON STATE UNIV;UNIV ARIZONA;LAB ECOL AND EVOLUT","WASHINGTON STATE UNIV",NA,"JONES EI, 2012, ANN NY ACAD SCI","JONES EI, 2012, ANN NY ACAD SCI"

EXAMPLES OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ARE DENSITY DEPENDENCE (POPULATION REGULATION) AND FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION (POLYMORPHISMS). POSITIVE FEEDBACK, IN TURN, PLAYS A ROLE IN FISHERIAN 'RUNAWAY' SEXUAL SELECTION, THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION, SELFING AND INBREEDING TOLERANCE UNDER PURGING OF DELETERIOUS ALLELES, AND THE EVOLUTION OF SEX DIFFERENCES IN PARENTAL CARE. ALL THESE EXAMPLES FEATURE SELF-REINFORCING PROCESSES WHERE THE INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF A TRAIT SELECTS FOR FURTHER INCREASES, SOMETIMES VIA A COEVOLUTIONARY FEEDBACK LOOP WITH ANOTHER TRAIT.

INTRIGUINGLY, 30 TO 40 PER CENT OF ALL NESTS ARE DESERTED BY BOTH PARENTS. TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTION OF THIS DIVERSE BREEDING SYSTEM AND FREQUENT CLUTCH DESERTION, WE USE 6 YEARS OF FIELD DATA TO DERIVE FITNESS EXPECTATIONS FOR MALES AND FEMALES DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY CARE FOR THEIR OFFSPRING. THE RESULTING PAYOFF MATRIX CORRESPONDS TO AN ASYMMETRIC SNOWDRIFT GAME WITH TWO ALTERNATIVE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES (ESSS): FEMALE-ONLY AND MALE-ONLY CARE. THIS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE POLYMORPHISM IN CARE STRATEGIES AND FREQUENT BIPARENTAL DESERTION, BECAUSE THEORY PREDICTS THAT ONE OF THE TWO ESSS SHOULD HAVE SPREAD TO FIXATION. USING A BOOTSTRAPPING APPROACH, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT TAKING ACCOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PAYOFFS EXPLAINS THE PATTERNS OF CARE BETTER THAN A MODEL BASED ON THE AVERAGE POPULATION PAYOFF MATRIX. IN PARTICULAR, A MODEL INCORPORATING DIFFERENCES IN MALE ATTRACTIVENESS CLOSELY PREDICTS THE OBSERVED FREQUENCIES OF MALE AND FEMALE DESERTION.

HOWEVER, FIELD EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE DOCUMENTING THESE SHIFTS HAS NEVER BEEN REPORTED FOR A CLEANING SYMBIOSIS. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE SHIFTS IN A FRESHWATER CLEANING SYMBIOSIS IN A SYSTEM INVOLVING CRAYFISH AND BRANCHIOBDELLID ANNELIDS. BRANCHIOBDELLIDS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT THEIR HOSTS UNDER SOME CONDITIONS BY CLEANING MATERIAL FROM HOST CRAYFISH'S GILL FILAMENTS. THE SYSTEM IS UNIQUELY SUITED AS AN EXPERIMENTAL MODEL FOR SYMBIOSIS DUE TO EASE OF MANIPULATION AND UBIQUITY OF THE ORGANISMS. IN THREE FIELD EXPERIMENTS, WE MANIPULATED DENSITIES OF WORMS ON HOST CRAYFISH AND MEASURED HOST GROWTH IN FIELD ENCLOSURES. IN ALL CASES, THE EXPERIMENTS REVEALED SHIFTS FROM MUTUALISM TO PARASITISM: HOST CRAYFISH GROWTH WAS HIGHEST AT INTERMEDIATE DENSITIES OF BRANCHIOBDELLID SYMBIONTS, WHILE HIGH SYMBIONT DENSITIES LED TO GROWTH THAT WAS LOWER OR NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM 0-WORM CONTROLS. GROWTH RESPONSES WERE CONSISTENT EVEN THOUGH THE THREE EXPERIMENTS INVOLVED DIFFERENT CRAYFISH AND WORM SPECIES AND WERE PERFORMED AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. RESULTS ALSO CLOSELY CONFORMED TO A PREVIOUS LABORATORY EXPERIMENT USING THE SAME SYSTEM. THE MECHANISM FOR THESE SHIFTS APPEARS TO BE THAT BRANCHIOBDELLIDS SWITCHED FROM CLEANING HOST GILLS AT INTERMEDIATE DENSITIES OF WORMS TO CONSUMING HOST GILL TISSUE AT HIGH DENSITIES. THESE OUTCOMES CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE SHIFTS ALONG A SYMBIOSIS CONTINUUM WITH THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO THE HOST AT INTERMEDIATE SYMBIONT DENSITIES. AT HIGH SYMBIONT DENSITIES, BENEFITS TO THE HOST DISAPPEAR, AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE FOR A WEAK PARASITISM. THESE ARE THE FIRST FIELD EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS TO DEMONSTRATE SUCH SHIFTS IN A CLEANING SYMBIOSIS.","[BROWN, BRYAN L.;; SKELTON, JAMES] CLEMSON UNIV, DEPT FORESTRY & NAT RESOURCES, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA.; [CREED, ROBERT P.;; ROLLINS, MARK A.;; FARRELL, KAITLIN J.;] APPALACHIAN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BOONE, NC 28608 USA.;","10.1007/s00442-012-2280-5","ARTICLE","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-0949823, DEB-0949780]; GRADUATE SCHOOL AT APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY; CLEMSON UNIVERSITY'S UNIVERSITY RESEARCH GRANT COMMITTEE; DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCESNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF -DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [0949823] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGYNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [0949823] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO KATIE GREENE, BRETT TORNWALL, LAURA AMMONS, JOSH LOMONACO, DAVID YOUNG, ADAM SPEAKE, RYAN HASSLER, TRAVIS KNOTT, CHELSAE WEITHMAN, PATTY WHITENER, JOHN BRUNT, JON BOROUGHS, TIM TORONGEAU, MATT SANDERSON, AND BRANDON CARPENTER FOR HELP WITH THE EXPERIMENTS.

BECAUSE SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IS OFTEN A PLASTIC RESPONSE TO THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, CONSISTENT VARIATION IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS SUCH AS AGGRESSION AND COOPERATION MAY GENERATE CONSISTENT VARIATION IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF SOCIAL PARTNERS AND OTHERS IN THE GROUP. IN THIS STUDY, WE MOVED INDIVIDUAL SUBORDINATE MALES BETWEEN GROUPS OF A COOPERATIVELY BREEDING CICHLID, NEOLAMPROLOGUS PULCHER. WE FOUND THAT SUBORDINATE MALES VARIED CONSISTENTLY IN THEIR AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING FISH. THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL SUBORDINATE MALES EXTENDED BEYOND THEIR DIRECT INTERACTIONS; AGONISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DOMINANT MALES AND DOMINANT FEMALES VARIED CONSISTENTLY WITH SUBORDINATE MALE IDENTITY. WE SUGGEST THAT VARIATION IN HELPING BEHAVIOUR THROUGH TERRITORIAL DEFENCE INFLUENCES THE NET FITNESS EFFECTS OF SUBORDINATE MALES ON DOMINANT MALES AND, THUS, THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT BETWEEN DOMINANT MALES AND DOMINANT FEMALES OVER SUBORDINATE MALE PRESENCE. THE EXISTENCE OF INDIRECT PHENOTYPIC EFFECTS OF SUBORDINATE MALES ON INTERACTIONS NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVING THE SUBORDINATE MALE SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITIES EXTEND INTO THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND MAY BE AN IMPORTANT SELECTIVE INFLUENCE ON SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND ON VARIATION AMONG SOCIAL GROUPS.

AGGRESSIVE PROPENSITY IS USUALLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CONSISTENT BEHAVIOURAL TYPES, POTENTIALLY GENERATING BENEFITS IN RESOURCE COMPETITION WITH CONSPECIFICS THAT MAY BE TRADED OFF AGAINST COSTS IN OTHER CONTEXTS (E.G. ACQUISITION OF MATES OR COEXISTENCE WITH GROUP MEMBERS). SUCH TRADE-OFFS HAVE NOT YET BEEN STUDIED IN HIGHLY SOCIAL SPECIES. WE INVESTIGATED HOW AGGRESSIVE PROPENSITY INFLUENCES COMPETITION FOR DOMINANCE, SHELTERS AND MATES IN THE COOPERATIVELY BREEDING CICHLID NEOLAMPROLOGUS PULCHER. FOLLOWING AN ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL WE COMPARED GROWTH TRAJECTORIES OF GROUPS OF FOUR FISH EITHER MATCHED OR UNMATCHED FOR AGGRESSIVE TYPE. FURTHERMORE, WE ANALYSED SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF SHELTER AND POSSIBLE MATING PARTNERS (BY PROXIMITY TO SHELTERS AND PROSPECTIVE MATES) ACCORDING TO AGGRESSIVE TYPE, SHOWING EITHER HIGH OR LOW AGGRESSION LEVELS. CONTRARY TO PREDICTION WE FOUND THAT DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOURAL IDIOSYNCRASIES AFFECTED THE LIKELIHOOD OF OBTAINING THE DOMINANT POSITION AND HIGH-QUALITY TERRITORIES ONLY MARGINALLY. SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, GROWTH RATES AND BODY RESERVE ACCUMULATION WERE AFFECTED BY BEHAVIOURAL DIFFERENCES. HOWEVER, THE PATTERNS OBSERVED IN THIS EXPERIMENT DIFFERED FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES AND SUGGEST A MODULATING EFFECT OF THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE LINK BETWEEN BEHAVIOURAL TYPES AND LIFE HISTORY DECISIONS.

ECTOPARASITES (SUCH AS FLEAS) MOVE STOCHASTICALLY BETWEEN HOSTS, CAUSING DIFFERENTIAL PARASITE BURDENS. THE RESULTING VARIANCE IN THE NEED FOR COOPERATION - IN THIS CASE COOPERATIVE ALLOGROOMING - MEANS THAT PAYOFFS FOR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES (E.G. COOPERATE AND DEFECT) ARE NOT FIXED.

THE EVOLUTION OF INCREASED RESISTANCE CAN BE CONSTRAINED BY CONSTITUTIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH POSSESSING DEFENSE MECHANISMS, AND BY INDUCED COSTS OF DEPLOYING THEM. THESE TWO TYPES OF COSTS ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED WITH RESPECT TO RESISTANCE AS A GENETICALLY DETERMINED TRAIT, BUT THEY MAY ALSO APPLY TO RESISTANCE PROVIDED BY HELPERS' SUCH AS BACTERIAL ENDOSYMBIONTS. WE INVESTIGATED THE COSTS OF SYMBIONT-CONFERRED RESISTANCE IN THE BLACK BEAN APHID, APHIS FABAE (SCOPOLI), WHICH RECEIVES STRONG PROTECTION AGAINST THE PARASITOID LYSIPHLEBUS FABARUM FROM THE DEFENSIVE ENDOSYMBIONT HAMILTONELLA DEFENSA. APHIDS INFECTED WITH H.DEFENSA WERE ALMOST TEN TIMES MORE RESISTANT TO L.FABARUM THAN GENETICALLY IDENTICAL APHIDS WITHOUT THIS SYMBIONT, BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF PARASITOIDS, THEY HAD STRONGLY REDUCED LIFESPANS, RESULTING IN LOWER LIFETIME REPRODUCTION. THIS IS EVIDENCE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL CONSTITUTIVE COST OF HARBORING H.DEFENSA. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY INDUCED COST OF SYMBIONT-CONFERRED RESISTANCE. ON THE CONTRARY, SYMBIONT-PROTECTED APHIDS THAT RESISTED A PARASITOID ATTACK ENJOYED INCREASED LONGEVITY AND LIFETIME REPRODUCTION COMPARED WITH UNATTACKED CONTROLS, WHEREAS UNPROTECTED APHIDS SUFFERED A REDUCTION OF LONGEVITY AND REPRODUCTION AFTER RESISTING AN ATTACK.

THESE INCLUDE TRANSACTIONAL MODELS, IN WHICH ONE GROUP MEMBER MAY ALLOCATE SOME GROUP PRODUCTIVITY TO ANOTHER TO PREVENT GROUP DISSOLUTION AND TUG-OF-WAR INEFFICIENCY MODELS, IN WHICH GROUP MEMBERS COMPETE FOR ACCESS TO RESOURCES AT A COST TO GROUP PRODUCTIVITY. ALTHOUGH SKEW MODELS INVOLVE A TRANSACTIONAL OR COMPETITIVE INTERACTION AMONG GROUP MEMBERS, MOST EXISTING MODELS DO NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO RESPOND TO NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF THEIR GROUP MATE. HERE, I EXPAND TRANSACTIONAL AND TUG-OF-WAR MODELS TO ALLOW ONE INDIVIDUAL (THE FOLLOWER) TO RESPOND PLASTICALLY TO A FIXED STRATEGY OF ITS PARTNER (THE LEADER). I SOLVE FOR THE STACKELBERG EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS FOR EACH MODEL. FOR THE TRANSACTIONAL MODEL, LEADERSHIP RESULTS IN A GREATER SHARE OF GROUP PRODUCTIVITY TO THE LEADER COMPARED WITH MODELS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE LEADERSHIP. WHEN THE FOLLOWER'S INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEADER'S STRATEGY IS PERFECT, THE EQUILIBRIUM DIVISION OF PRODUCTIVITY DOES NOT VARY WITH RELATEDNESS, IN CONTRAST TO THE PREDICTIONS OF PREVIOUS SKEW MODELS, AND THE EFFECTS OF ECOLOGICAL VARIABLES MAY CHANGE. IN THE TUG-OF-WAR MODEL, LEADERSHIP INFLUENCES EQUILIBRIUM INVESTMENT IN COMPETITION ONLY IF RELATEDNESS IS GREATER THAN ZERO. DOMINANT LEADERS RECEIVE A LARGER SHARE OF GROUP PRODUCTIVITY, BUT GROUP PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES AND GROUPING IS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL OVER A SMALLER PARAMETER RANGE THAN IN THE ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP. SUBORDINATE LEADERS RECEIVE A SMALLER SHARE OF GROUP PRODUCTIVITY, BUT BENEFIT FROM OVERALL HIGHER GROUP PRODUCTIVITY.","[HAMILTON, IAN M.;] OHIO STATE UNIV, DEPT EVOLUT ECOL & ORGANISMAL BIOL, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.; [HAMILTON, IAN M.;] OHIO STATE UNIV, DEPT MATH, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.;","10.1093/beheco/ars182","ARTICLE","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITYOHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY TO I.M.H.","2","BEHAV ECOL","BEHAV.

WHILE THE EVOLUTIONARY REASONS OF GROUP-LIVING ARE WELL STUDIED, THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL SYSTEMS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. BY STUDYING GROUP-LIVING AND SOLITARY INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME SPECIES, WE CAN DETERMINE HORMONAL CORRELATES OF SOCIALITY WITHOUT THE PROBLEM OF CONFOUNDING PHYLOGENETIC FACTORS. THE AFRICAN STRIPED MOUSE (RHABDOMYS PUMILIO) IS A SOCIALLY FLEXIBLE SPECIES, WHICH CAN BE SOLITARY OR ALTERNATIVELY FORM COMPLEX FAMILY GROUPS, DEPENDING ON POPULATION DENSITY AND THE EXTENT OF REPRODUCTIVE COMPETITION. WE PREDICTED GROUP-LIVING STRIPED MICE TO SHOW SIGNS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUPPRESSION AND SOCIAL STRESS, RESULTING IN HIGHER CORTICOSTERONE BUT LOWER TESTOSTERONE LEVELS WHEN COMPARED TO SOLITARY-LIVING INDIVIDUALS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL ORGANIZATION CORRELATED WITH HORMONAL DIFFERENCES, WE COLLECTED BLOOD SAMPLES FROM FREE-LIVING STRIPED MICE DURING FOUR BREEDING SEASONS WHEN WE EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED SOLITARY-LIVING IN PHILOPATRIC INDIVIDUALS BY LOCALLY REDUCING POPULATION DENSITY. STRIPED MICE THAT WERE GROUP-LIVING DID NOT CHANGE THEIR CORTICOSTERONE OR ESTOSTERONE LEVELS DURING THE STUDY, INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO TEMPORAL EFFECT DURING THE BREEDING SEASON. STRIPED MICE OF BOTH SEXES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS AFTER SWITCHING FROM GROUP- TO SOLITARY-LIVING. SOLITARY MALES - BUT NOT SOLITARY FEMALES - HAD HIGHER TESTOSTERONE LEVELS THAN GROUP-LIVING CONSPECIFICS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT GROUP-LIVING RESULTS IN PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS AND CAN INDUCE REPRODUCTIVE SUPPRESSION, AT LEAST IN PHILOPATRIC MALES. THE SWITCH TO SOLITARY-LIVING MAY THUS BE A TACTIC TO AVOID REPRODUCTIVE COMPETITION WITHIN GROUPS, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS HORMONE LEVELS AND ONSET OF INDEPENDENT REPRODUCTION.

THE COEVOLUTION OF PLANT REWARD AND ANIMAL CHOOSINESS, HOWEVER, INVOLVES AN APPARENT PARADOX DUE TO INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND LIMITED MUTATION RATES: PLANT REWARDS EVOLVE ONLY WHEN ANIMALS ARE CHOOSY, BUT CHOOSY ANIMALS PURGE THE HERITABLE VARIATIONS OF PLANTS, WHICH THEN FAVORS LESS CHOOSY ANIMALS. HERE WE USE A TWO-SPECIES MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO ILLUSTRATE HOW NON-HERITABLE PHENOTYPIC VARIANCES OF PLANTS MAY FACILITATE THE COEVOLUTION OF REWARDS AND CHOOSINESS AND SOLVE THE PARADOX WITH LOW MUTATION RATES. WE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRACK THE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS AND SHOW THAT THE POPULATION RATIO LINKS THE TWO PROCESSES AND TUNES THE STABLE ECOEVOLUTIONARY EQUILIBRIUM. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS CONFIRM THE ANALYTIC PREDICTION WITH VARYING MUTATION RATES (HERITABLE VARIANCE).

EXISTING THEORETICAL WORK ON THE CONFLICT OVER CARE HAS: (A) RARELY CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE OF TACTICAL INVESTMENT DURING OFFSPRING PRODUCTION ON LATER CONTRIBUTIONS TO OFFSPRING REARING; (B) CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON BIPARENTAL CARE, RATHER THAN COOPERATIVELY CARING GROUPS COMPRISING BOTH PARENTS AND HELPERS; AND (C) TYPICALLY IGNORED RELATEDNESS BETWEEN CARERS AS A POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON INVESTMENT BEHAVIOR. WE USE A GAME-THEORETICAL APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF FEMALE PRODUCTION TACTICS AND DIFFERING GROUP RELATEDNESS STRUCTURES ON THE EXPECTED REARING INVESTMENT CONTRIBUTED BY BREEDING FEMALES, BREEDING MALES, AND HELPERS IN COOPERATIVE GROUPS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BREEDING FEMALE SHOULD PAY HIGHER COSTS OVERALL WHEN HELPFUL HELPERS ARE PRESENT, AS SHE PRODUCES ADDITIONAL OFFSPRING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE AVAILABLE CARE. WE FIND THAT HELPERS RELATED TO OFFSPRING THROUGH THE BREEDING FEMALE RATHER THAN THE BREEDING MALE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE LESS TO CARE, AND DECREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTION AS GROUP SIZE INCREASES, BECAUSE THE FEMALE REFRAINS FROM PRODUCING ADDITIONAL OFFSPRING TO EXPLOIT THEM. FINALLY, WITHIN-GROUP VARIATION IN HELPER RELATEDNESS ALSO AFFECTS INDIVIDUAL HELPER INVESTMENT RULES BY INFLATING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO CARE OF DISSIMILAR HELPERS. OUR FINDINGS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING MATERNAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS DURING OFFSPRING PRODUCTION TO UNDERSTAND INVESTMENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE BREEDING ATTEMPT, AND PROVIDE EMPIRICALLY TESTABLE PREDICTIONS CONCERNING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN MATERNAL, PATERNAL AND HELPER INVESTMENT AND HOW THESE ARE MODIFIED BY DIFFERENT RELATEDNESS STRUCTURES.","[SAVAGE, JAMES L.;; JOHNSTONE, RUFUS A.;] UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT ZOOL, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EJ, ENGLAND.; [RUSSELL, ANDREW F.;] UNIV EXETER CORNWALL CAMPUS, COLL LIFE & ENVIRONM SCI, CTR ECOL & CONSERVAT, PENRYN TR10 9EZ, ENGLAND.;","10.1007/s00265-013-1595-5","ARTICLE","NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL STUDENTSHIPNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL; ROYAL SOCIETY UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL STUDENTSHIP TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE (J.L.S.)

TO HUMAN SOCIETIES, IS A MAJOR QUESTION IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. A LARGE LITERATURE ASKS: WHAT PREVENTS SELECTION FOR CHEATING WITHIN COOPERATIVE LINEAGES? IN MUTUALISMS, OR COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES, FEEDBACK BETWEEN PARTNERS OFTEN ALIGNS THEIR FITNESS INTERESTS, SUCH THAT COOPERATIVE SYMBIONTS RECEIVE MORE BENEFITS FROM THEIR HOSTS THAN UNCOOPERATIVE SYMBIONTS. BUT HOW DO THESE FEEDBACKS EVOLVE? CHEATERS MIGHT INVADE SYMBIONT POPULATIONS AND SELECT FOR HOSTS THAT PREFERENTIALLY REWARD OR ASSOCIATE WITH COOPERATORS (OFTEN TERMED SANCTIONS OR PARTNER CHOICE); HOSTS MIGHT ADAPT TO VARIATION IN SYMBIONT QUALITY THAT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO CHEATING (E.G., ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION); OR CONDITIONAL HOST RESPONSES MIGHT EXIST BEFORE CHEATERS DO, MAKING MUTUALISMS STABLE FROM THE OUTSET. I REVIEW EVIDENCE FROM YUCCA-YUCCA MOTH, FIG-FIG WASP, AND LEGUME-RHIZOBIUM MUTUALISMS, WHICH ARE COMMONLY CITED AS MUTUALISMS STABILIZED BY SANCTIONS. BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT CHEATERS SELECT FOR HOST SANCTIONS IN THESE SYSTEMS; CHEATERS ARE TOO UNCOMMON. RECOGNIZING THAT SANCTIONS LIKELY EVOLVED FOR FUNCTIONS OTHER THAN RETALIATION AGAINST CHEATERS OFFERS MANY INSIGHTS ABOUT MUTUALISM COEVOLUTION, AND ABOUT WHY MUTUALISM EVOLVES IN ONLY SOME LINEAGES OF POTENTIAL HOSTS.","UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TORONTO, ON M5S 3G5, CANADA.;","10.1086/673757","REVIEW","NSERCNATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA; CONNAUGHT NEW RESEARCHER AWARD; ONTARIO MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION EARLY RESEARCHER AWARD; UNIVERSITY OF TORONTOUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO","I AM ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO K.

NATURAL ISOLATES OF THE SOIL BACTERIUM MYXOCOCCUS XANTHUS SAMPLED FROM THE SAME FRUITING BODY OFTEN VARY IN SOCIAL PHENOTYPES, SUCH AS GROUP SWARMING AND MULTICELLULAR DEVELOPMENT. HERE, WE TESTED WHETHER GENOTYPES HIGHLY PROFICIENT AT SWARMING OR DEVELOPMENT MIGHT PROMOTE THE PERSISTENCE OF LESS SOCIALLY PROFICIENT GENOTYPES FROM THE SAME FRUITING BODY. FAST-SWARMING STRAINS COMPLEMENTED SLOWER ISOLATES, ALLOWING THE LATTER TO KEEP PACE WITH FASTER STRAINS IN MIXED GROUPS. DURING DEVELOPMENT, ONE LOW-SPORULATING STRAIN WAS ANTAGONIZED BY HIGH SPORULATORS, WHEREAS OTHERS WITH SEVERE DEVELOPMENTAL DEFECTS HAD THOSE DEFECTS PARTIALLY COMPLEMENTED BY HIGH-SPORULATING STRAINS. DESPITE DECLINING IN FREQUENCY OVERALL DURING COMPETITION EXPERIMENTS SPANNING MULTIPLE CYCLES OF DEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENTALLY DEFECTIVE STRAINS EXHIBITED ADVANTAGES DURING THE GROWTH PHASES OF COMPETITIONS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MICROBES WITH LOW-SOCIALITY PHENOTYPES OFTEN BENEFIT FROM INTERACTING WITH MORE SOCIALLY PROFICIENT STRAINS.

SUCH A VIEW IS HOWEVER INCREASINGLY AT ODDS WITH THE GROWING EMPIRICAL LITERATURE, SHOWING NONTRIVIAL LEVELS OF SIGNAL VARIATION WITHIN PREY POPULATIONS. KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THIS VARIATION, WE ARGUE, COULD BE A RECOGNITION THAT TOXICITY LEVELS FREQUENTLY VARY WITHIN POPULATIONS BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HETEROGENEITY. INEQUALITIES IN DEFENSE MAY UNDERMINE MUTUALISTIC MONOMORPHIC SIGNALING, CAUSING EVOLUTIONARY ANTAGONISM BETWEEN LOCI THAT DETERMINE APPEARANCE OF LESS WELL-DEFENDED AND BETTER DEFENDED PREY FORMS WITHIN SPECIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE APPLY A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF EVOLVED PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY TO THE EVOLUTION OF PREY SIGNALS. WE SHOW THAT WHEN TOXICITY LEVELS VARY, THEN ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS CAN LEAD TO EVOLUTIONARY CONFLICT BETWEEN ALLELES AT DIFFERENT SIGNALING LOCI, CAUSING SIGNAL EVOLUTION, ""RED QUEEN-LIKE"" EVOLUTIONARY CHASE, AND ONE OR MORE FORMS OF SIGNALING EQUILIBRIA.

MATHEMATICAL MODELS TYPICALLY FIND THAT SUCH CONFLICT CAN BE RESOLVED BY PARTIAL-RESPONSE STRATEGIES, LEADING INVESTORS TO CONTRIBUTE RELATIVELY EQUITABLY. USING A CASE STUDY APPROACH, WE SHOW THAT SUCH MODEL EXPECTATIONS CAN BE CONTRADICTED IN AT LEAST FOUR DISPARATE CONTEXTS: (I) BI-PARENTAL CARE; (II) COOPERATIVE BREEDING; (III) COOPERATIVE HUNTING; AND (IV) HUMAN COOPERATION. WE HIGHLIGHT THAT: (A) MARKED VARIATION IN CONTRIBUTIONS IS COMMONPLACE; AND (B) INDIVIDUALS CAN OFTEN RESPOND POSITIVELY RATHER THAN NEGATIVELY TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OTHERS. EXISTING MODELS HAVE SURPRISINGLY LIMITED POWER IN EXPLAINING THESE PHENOMENA. HERE, WE PROPOSE THAT, ALTHOUGH AMONG-INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN COOPERATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE INFLUENCED BY DIFFERENTIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS, THERE IS LIKELY TO BE A STRONG GENETIC OR EPIGENETIC COMPONENT. WE THEN SUGGEST THAT SELECTION CAN MAINTAIN HIGH INVESTORS (KEY INDIVIDUALS) WHEN THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS PROMOTE SUPPORT BY INCREASING THE BENEFITS AND/OR REDUCING THE COSTS FOR OTHERS.

THE FIRST IS VARIATION: EVEN APART FROM THE VAST NUMBER OF EXTANT SPECIES, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A SINGLE SPECIES. THE SECOND PROPERTY IS COOPERATION. IT IS SURPRISING THAT UNTIL RECENTLY THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO PROPERTIES HAVE RARELY BEEN ADDRESSED FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY POINT OF VIEW. HERE, I CONCENTRATE ON HOW INTER-INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION. FIRST, I DEAL WITH CASES WHERE INDIVIDUALITY IS MAINTAINED BY RANDOM PROCESSES LIKE MUTATION OR PHENOTYPIC NOISE. SECOND, I EXAMINE WHEN DIFFERENCES IN STATE CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOUR. FINALLY, I INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL ROLE SPECIALIZATION. VARIATION CAN BE IMPORTANT IN SEVERAL WAYS. INCREASED RANDOM VARIATION CAN CHANGE THE EXPECTATION ABOUT COOPERATIVENESS OF FUTURE PARTNERS, ALTERING BEHAVIOUR IN A CURRENT RELATIONSHIP. DIFFERENCES IN STATE MAY SERVE AS A BOOK-KEEPING MECHANISM THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE EVOLUTION OF RECIPROCITY. IF THE COST OF COOPERATION CAN DEPEND ON STATE THEN STRATEGIC REGULATION OF STATE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO COERCE PARTNERS TO COOPERATE. IF CONDITIONS FORCE INDIVIDUALS TO SPECIALIZE, COOPERATION BECOMES MORE VALUABLE. MY REVIEW OF THEORETICAL MODELS SUGGESTS THAT VARIATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION.","[BARTA, ZOLTAN] UNIV DEBRECEN, DEPT EVOLUTIONARY ZOOL, MTA DE LENDULET BEHAV ECOL RES GRP, H-4032 DEBRECEN, HUNGARY.;","10.1098/rstb.2015.0087","REVIEW","EUROPEAN UNIONEUROPEAN UNION (EU); EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUNDEUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND (ESF); [SROP-4.2.2.B-15/1/KONV-2015-0001]","THE PUBLICATION WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SROP-4.2.2.B-15/1/KONV-2015-0001 PROJECT.

RECENT RESEARCH, HOWEVER, INDICATES THAT THE ABILITY TO FORM COOPERATIVE SOCIAL BONDS HAS AN EQUALLY STRONG EFFECT ON FITNESS. TWO IMPLICATIONS FOLLOW. FIRST, STRONG SOCIAL BONDS MAKE INDIVIDUALS' FITNESS INTERDEPENDENT AND THE 'FREE-RIDER' PROBLEM DISAPPEARS. SECOND, INDIVIDUALS MUST MAKE ADAPTIVE CHOICES THAT BALANCE COMPETITION AND COOPERATION-OFTEN WITH THE SAME PARTNERS. THE PROXIMATE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THESE BEHAVIOURS ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING TO BE UNDERSTOOD. RECENT RESULTS FROM COGNITIVE AND SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE PROVIDE US SOME EVIDENCE THAT MANY SOCIAL AND NON-SOCIAL DECISIONS ARE MEDIATED ULTIMATELY BY ABSTRACT, DOMAIN-GENERAL NEURAL MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, OTHER POPULATIONS OF NEURONS IN THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX, STRIATUM, AMYGDALA AND PARIETAL CORTEX SPECIFICALLY ENCODE THE TYPE, IMPORTANCE AND VALUE OF SOCIAL INFORMATION. WHETHER THESE SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS OF NEURONS ARISE BY SELECTION OR THROUGH DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES OF SOCIAL LIFE REMAINS UNKNOWN. MANY BRAIN AREAS ARE HOMOLOGOUS AND SHOW SIMILAR PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY IN HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN PRIMATES. IN BOTH GROUPS, CORTICAL ACTIVITY IS MODULATED BY HORMONES LIKE OXYTOCIN AND BY THE ACTION OF CERTAIN GENES THAT MAY AFFECT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOUR.

SUCH COORDINATION, HOWEVER, OFTEN OCCURS SELECTIVELY, AND THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ANIMALS USE TO DETERMINE WHEN THEY COORDINATE AND WHEN THEY DO NOT IS UNCLEAR. WE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE IN THE HIGHLY TERRITORIAL DOWNY WOODPECKER (PICOIDES PUBESCENS) BY EXPLORING HOW INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A SOCIAL BREEDING PAIR DIFFERENTIALLY MODULATE COORDINATED AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES DURING GRADED SIMULATED TERRITORIAL INTRUSIONS (STIS). ANALYSES SHOW THAT RESIDENT PAIRS MOUNT A MORE ROBUST AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE TO STIS THAT REPRESENT A GREATER THREAT. MOREOVER, IN THIS SOCIAL CONTEXT, PAIR MEMBERS PRODUCE CONTACT VOCALIZATIONS IN A WAY THAT PREDICTS THEIR PARTNER'S AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO SHOW THAT, WHEN PRESENTED WITH A LOW THREAT, INDIVIDUALS THAT FIRST RESPOND TO INTRUSIONS DECREASE THEIR AGGRESSIVE OUTPUT ONCE THEIR PARTNER ATTENDS TO THE STIMULUS; THE PARTNER, IN TURN, INCREASES THEIR LEVELS OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. THIS DOES NOT OCCUR IN HIGH-THREAT STIS, WHERE BOTH PARTNERS MAINTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF AGGRESSION THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ENCOUNTER. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A PAIR FLEXIBLY ADJUST THEIR AGGRESSIVE TACTICS IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT SOCIAL COMPETITIVE CONTEXTS, AND THIS INCLUDES ADJUSTING THE WAY IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS COORDINATE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THEIR AGONISTIC REPERTOIRE. WE SPECULATE THAT THIS ABILITY REFLECTS AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO FINE-TUNE TERRITORIAL TACTICS TO REDUCE OVERALL COSTS OF AGGRESSION. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUALS OFTEN COORDINATE THEIR BEHAVIOR TO ACCOMPLISH COMMON TASKS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE WHEN SUCH COORDINATION OCCURS AND WHEN IT DOES NOT. WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HIGHLY TERRITORIAL DOWNY WOODPECKER BY TESTING HOW THE LEVEL OF THREAT ASSOCIATED WITH A TERRITORIAL INTERACTION INFLUENCES THE COORDINATION OF DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR. WE FIND THAT, WHEN FACING INTRUDERS THAT POSE A GREATER THREAT, RESIDENTS ADJUST LEVELS OF AGGRESSIVE OUTPUT IN RESPONSE TO THE NUMBER OF VOCALIZATIONS PRODUCED BY THEIR BREEDING PARTNER. BY CONTRAST, THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT OBSERVED WHEN PAIRS FACE INTRUDERS THAT POSE A RELATIVELY LOWER THREAT. OUR DATA THEREFORE PROVIDE STRIKING EVIDENCE THAT COORDINATION IN DEFENSIVE TACTICS DEPENDS ON THE RESIDENTS' APPRAISAL OF THE SOCIAL CONTEXT, SUCH THAT FIERCER COMPETITION IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER BEHAVIORAL COORDINATION.","[SCHUPPE, ERIC R.;; SANIN, GLORIA D.;; FUXJAGER, MATTHEW J.;] WAKE FOREST UNIV, DEPT BIOL, WINSTON SALEM, NC 27109 USA.;","10.1007/s00265-016-2088-0","ARTICLE","WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY","WE THANK JOHNNY PETERSON, ASHTON CAUDLE, AND MIA HARRIS FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN COLLECTING AND ANALYZING THE DATA.

THESE ASSEMBLAGES OFTEN CHANGE THROUGHOUT HOST ONTOGENY, BUT THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THESE CHANGES AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES FOR HOST FITNESS ARE SELDOM REVEALED. HERE WE EXAMINE A CLEANING SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN CRAYFISH AND AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ECTOSYMBIOTIC BRANCHIOBDELLIDAN WORMS TO UNCOVER WHAT MECHANISMS DRIVE CHANGES IN SYMBIONT COMPOSITION DURING HOST ONTOGENY AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHANGES FOR BOTH THE HOST AND SYMBIONTS. IN SURVEYS OF A NORTH CAROLINA RIVER, THE DOMINANT WORM SPECIES SHIFTED FROM CAMBARINCOLA PHILADELPHICUS TO CAMBARINCOLA INGENS AS CRAYFISH (CAMBARUS BARTONII) INCREASED IN SIZE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS SHIFT IS A FUNCTION OF HOST REGULATION BY SMALL CRAYFISH AND EXCLUSION BY A DOMINANT SYMBIONT ON LARGE CRAYFISH. IN A CONTROLLED LAB EXPERIMENT, SMALL CRAYFISH OFTEN REMOVED THEIR SYMBIONTS BUT C. INGENS WAS REMOVED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN C. PHILADELPHICUS. IN CONTRAST, C. INGENS HAD HIGHER SURVIVORSHIP AND REPRODUCTION THAN C. PHILADELPHICUS ON LARGE CRAYFISH. WE ALSO MEASURED THE EFFECT OF EACH WORM SPECIES ON CRAYFISH GROWTH THROUGH ONTOGENY; NEITHER WORM SPECIES HAD AN EFFECT ON SMALL CRAYFISH BUT BOTH SPECIES HAD SIMILAR POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE GROWTH OF LARGE CRAYFISH RELATIVE TO CONTROLS. EVIDENCE FROM ANOTHER EXPERIMENT SUGGESTED THAT INTRAGUILD PREDATION BY C. INGENS CAUSED A DECLINE IN C. PHILADELPHICUS ON LARGE CRAYFISH. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SHIFTS IN PARTNER FITNESS ARE A FUNCTION OF HOST SIZE AND THAT THESE SHIFTS CAN INVOLVE THE SUCCESSION OF SYMBIONTS. FURTHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CHANGES IN THE OUTCOME OF SYMBIOSES CAN REMAIN ROBUST THROUGHOUT HOST ONTOGENY DESPITE INTERACTIVE MECHANISMS THAT LEAD TO SHIFTS IN SYMBIONT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE.","[THOMAS, MICHAEL J.;; CREED, ROBERT P.;] APPALACHIAN STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, BOONE, NC 28608 USA.; [SKELTON, JAMES; BROWN, BRYAN L.;] VIRGINIA TECH, DEPT BIOL SCI, 2013 DERRING HALL, BLACKSBURG, VA 24061 USA.; [SKELTON, JAMES] UNIV FLORIDA, SCH FOREST RESOURCES & CONSERVAT, NEWINS ZIEGLER HALL, GAINESVILLE, FL 32603 USA.;","10.1890/15-1443.1","ARTICLE","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-0949823, DEB-0949780]; BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY (ASU); DOMER AWARD FROM THE GRADUATE SCHOOL AT ASU","JENNIFER GEIB, MICHAEL GANGLOFF, AND TWO ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS PROVIDED VALUABLE COMMENTS ON PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF THEIR EFFECTS IS UNCLEAR: BOTH FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO PROMOTE HELPING BEHAVIOR. RECENT STUDIES PROVIDE A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THESE CONFLICTING RESULTS BY SUGGESTING THAT INCREASED ECOLOGICAL VARIABILITY, RATHER THAN CHANGES IN MEAN CONDITIONS, PROMOTE COOPERATIVE CARE. HOWEVER, NO STUDY HAS TESTED WHETHER INCREASED ECOLOGICAL VARIABILITY PROMOTES INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL HELPING BEHAVIOR OR THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. WE TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS IN A LONG-TERM STUDY POPULATION OF THE COOPERATIVELY BREEDING BANDED MONGOOSE, MUNGOS MUNGO, USING 14 YEARS OF BEHAVIORAL AND METEOROLOGICAL DATA TO EXPLORE HOW THE MEAN AND VARIABILITY OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR, BODY CONDITION, AND SURVIVAL. FEMALE BODY CONDITION WAS MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN RAINFALL LEADING TO POORER FEMALE SURVIVAL AND PRONOUNCED MALE-BIASED GROUP COMPOSITIONS AFTER PERIODS OF HIGH RAINFALL VARIABILITY. AFTER SUCH PERIODS, OLDER MALES INVESTED MORE IN HELPING BEHAVIOR, POTENTIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAD FEWER MATING OPPORTUNITIES. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE THE FIRST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED INDIVIDUAL HELPING EFFORT IN MORE VARIABLE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND SUGGEST THIS ARISES BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECT OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON BODY CONDITION AND SURVIVAL, AND THE KNOCK-ON EFFECT ON SOCIAL GROUP COMPOSITION. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SENSITIVITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY, AND THE IMPACTS THIS HAS ON THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF ANIMAL GROUPS, CAN EXERT A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS COOPERATIVE CARE.","[MARSHALL, HARRY H.;; SANDERSON, JENNIFER L.;; HARES, MICHELLE C.;; INZANI, EMMA; THOMPSON, FAYE J.;; VITIKAINEN, EMMA I.; K.;; CANT, MICHAEL A.;] UNIV EXETER, CTR ECOL & CONSERVAT, CORNWALL CAMPUS,TRELIEVER RD, PENRYN TR10 9FE, CORNWALL, ENGLAND.; [MWANGHUYA, FRANCIS; BUSINGE, ROBERT; KYABULIMA, SOLOMON; MWESIGE, KENNETH] BANDED MONGOOSE RES PROJECT, QUEEN ELIZABETH NATL PK, KASESE, UGANDA.; [KALEMA-ZIKUSOKA, GLADYS] CONSERVAT PUBL HLTH, PLOT 3,MAPEERA LANE, ENTEBBE, UGANDA.;","10.1093/beheco/arw006","ARTICLE","EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL STARTING GRANT (SOCODEV); NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL (UK)NERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL [NE/J010278/1]; NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCILNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL [NE/J010278/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH","THE RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY A EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL STARTING GRANT (SOCODEV) AND A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL (UK) STANDARD GRANT (NE/J010278/1).","4","BEHAV ECOL","BEHAV.

ONE MECHANISM THAT MAY PROMOTE COOPERATION IS NEGOTIATION': INDIVIDUALS ALTERING THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN RESPONSE TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF OTHERS. NEGOTIATING INDIVIDUALS DECIDE THEIR ACTIONS THROUGH A RECURSIVE PROCESS OF RECIPROCAL OBSERVATION, THEREBY REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF FREE RIDING. EVOLUTIONARY GAMES WITH RESPONSE RULES HAVE SHOWN THAT INFINITELY MANY FORMS OF THE RULE CAN BE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE SIMULTANEOUSLY, UNLESS THERE IS VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL QUALITY. THIS POTENTIALLY RESTRICTS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH NEGOTIATION COULD MAINTAIN COOPERATION. ORGANISMS INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN A NOISY WORLD IN WHICH COOPERATIVE EFFORT AND THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFORT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ERROR. HERE, WE SHOW THAT SUCH NOISE CAN MAKE THE NUMBER OF EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE RULES FINITE, EVEN WITHOUT QUALITY VARIATION, AND SO NOISE COULD HELP MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR. WE SHOW THAT THE CURVATURE OF THE BENEFIT FUNCTION IS THE KEY FACTOR DETERMINING WHETHER INDIVIDUALS INVEST MORE OR LESS AS THEIR PARTNER'S INVESTMENT INCREASES, INVESTING LESS WHEN THE BENEFIT TO INVESTMENT HAS DIMINISHING RETURNS. IF THE BENEFITS OF LOW INVESTMENT ARE VERY SMALL THEN BEHAVIOURAL FLEXIBILITY TENDS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION, BECAUSE NEGOTIATION ENABLES COOPERATORS TO REACH LARGE BENEFITS. UNDER SOME CONDITIONS, THIS LEADS TO A REPEATING CYCLE IN WHICH COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR RISES AND FALLS OVER TIME, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN BETWEEN-POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR. IN OTHER CONDITIONS, NEGOTIATION LEADS TO EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF COOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR, SUGGESTING THAT BEHAVIOURAL FLEXIBILITY COULD FACILITATE THE EVOLUTION OF EUSOCIALITY IN THE ABSENCE OF HIGH RELATEDNESS.","[ITO, K.;] KYUSHU UNIV, SCH SCI, NISHI KU, FUKUOKA, JAPAN.; [ITO, K.;; YAMAUCHI, A.;] KYOTO UNIV, CTR ECOL RES, OTSU, SHIGA, JAPAN.; [ITO, K.;; HIGGINSON, A.; D.;] UNIV EXETER, COLL LIFE & ENVIRONM SCI, CTR RES ANIM BEHAV, EXETER, DEVON, ENGLAND.; [MCNAMARA, J.; M.;] UNIV BRISTOL, SCH MATH, BRISTOL, AVON, ENGLAND.;","10.1111/jeb.13030","ARTICLE","JSPS KAKENHI GRANTMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCEGRANTS-IN-AID FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (KAKENHI) [15K07219]; JSPS RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP FOR YOUNG SCIENTISTSMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCE [14J00472]; EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL GRANTEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC) [250209]; NERC INDEPENDENT RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP [NE/L011921/1]; UNIVERSITY OF EXETER COLLEGE OF LIFE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCILNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL [NE/L011921/1, NE/L011921/2] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH; GRANTS-IN-AID FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCEGRANTS-IN-AID FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (KAKENHI) [15K07219] FUNDING SOURCE: KAKEN","THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO LUKE HOLMAN AND JEAN-BAPTISTE ANDRE FOR COMMENTS ON AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS MANUSCRIPT AND TO ANDY GARDNER FOR GUIDANCE.

A SPECIAL CASE OF SUCH INTERACTIONS IS APPARENT PREDATION' - WHEN VARIATION IN SEED PRODUCTION OF ONE TREE SPECIES CHANGES THE OUTCOME OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SEED HOARDERS AND ANOTHER TREE SPECIES FROM SEED DISPERSAL MUTUALISM TO PREDATION. WE INVESTIGATED HOW TWO SPECIES OF AVIAN HOARDERS RESPONDED TO DIFFERENCES IN ACORN AVAILABILITY AMONG INDIVIDUAL VALLEY OAKS (QUERCUS LOBATA) AND ACROSS A LANDSCAPE DOMINATED BY BLUE OAKS (Q.DOUGLASII) TO DETERMINE WHETHER SEED DISPERSAL AND PREDATION DYNAMICS RESULT IN APPARENT PREDATION BETWEEN THESE OAK SPECIES. CALIFORNIA SCRUB-JAYS (APHELOCOMA CALIFORNICA), HIGH-QUALITY SEED DISPERSERS WITH LARGE SPATIAL SCALES OF RESOURCE PERCEPTION, SHOWED STRONG NUMERICAL AND FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES TO INDIVIDUALLY LARGE Q.LOBATA ACORN CROPS WHEN LANDSCAPE-LEVEL ACORN CROPS WERE LOW, BUT THE NUMERICAL RESPONSE WAS NOT OBSERVED WHEN Q.DOUGLASII PRODUCED A GOOD ACORN CROP THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. IN CONTRAST, ACORN WOODPECKERS (MELANERPES FORMICIVORUS), WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT ACORN PREDATORS, EXHIBITED A CONSISTENT FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE TO INDIVIDUAL Q.LOBATA ACORN CROPS INDEPENDENT OF LANDSCAPE-WIDE AVAILABILITY. CONSEQUENTLY, Q.LOBATA EXPERIENCED INCREASED PREDATION AND A NEAR ABSENCE OF HIGH-QUALITY SEED DISPERSAL WHEN Q.DOUGLASII ACORNS WERE ABUNDANT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT APPARENT PREDATION AMONG OAK SPECIES CAN ARISE FROM CONTRASTING RESPONSES OF GENERALIST SEED PREDATORS AND DISPERSERS TO ACORN AVAILABILITY ON DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES. THUS, THE SPATIAL SCALE OF RESOURCE PERCEPTION, WHICH CAN DIFFER GREATLY AMONG GENERALIST SEED HOARDERS, MAY PROVIDE A PROXIMATE MECHANISM UNDERLYING INDIRECT, TEMPORALLY VARIABLE ECOLOGICAL AFFECTS SUCH AS APPARENT PREDATION AMONG SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF LARGE-SEEDED TREES.","[PESENDORFER, MARIO B.;; KOENIG, WALTER D.;] CORNELL LAB ORNITHOL, 159 SAPSUCKER WOODS RD, ITHACA, NY 14850 USA.; [KOENIG, WALTER D.;] UNIV CALIF, HASTINGS RESERVAT, 38601 E.; CARMEL VALLEY RD, CARMEL VALLEY, CA USA.;","10.1111/1365-2435.12770","ARTICLE","NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-1256394]; DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCESNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1256394] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGYNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1256394] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY NSF GRANT DEB-1256394.

THIS REVIEW EVALUATES THIS QUESTION, NECESSARY FOR A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION. FIRST, WE OUTLINE THREE ADVANTAGES OF COOPERATION RELATIVE TO NONCOOPERATION (ACQUISITION OF OTHERWISE INACCESSIBLE GOODS AND SERVICES, MORE EFFICIENT ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES, AND BUFFERING AGAINST VARIABILITY), AND PREDICT WHEN INDIVIDUALS SHOULD COOPERATE WITH A CONSPECIFIC VERSUS A HETEROSPECIFIC PARTNER TO OBTAIN THESE ADVANTAGES. SECOND, WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE AXES ALONG WHICH HETEROSPECIFIC AND CONSPECIFIC PARTNERS MAY DIFFER: RELATEDNESS AND FITNESS FEEDBACKS, COMPETITION AND RESOURCE USE, RESOURCE-GENERATION ABILITIES, RELATIVE EVOLUTIONARY RATES, AND ASYMMETRIC STRATEGY SETS AND OUTSIDE OPTIONS. ALONG ALL OF THESE AXES, CERTAIN ASYMMETRIES BETWEEN PARTNERS ARE MORE COMMON IN, BUT NOT EXCLUSIVE TO, COOPERATION BETWEEN SPECIES, ESPECIALLY COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE USE AND PRODUCTION. WE CONCLUDE THAT COOPERATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN SPECIES SHARE MANY FUNDAMENTAL QUALITIES, AND THAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS ARE EXPLAINED BY THE VARIOUS ASYMMETRIES BETWEEN PARTNERS. CONSIDERATION OF THE PARALLELS BETWEEN INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC COOPERATION FACILITATES APPLICATION OF WELL-STUDIED TOPICS IN ONE SYSTEM TO THE OTHER, SUCH AS DIRECT BENEFITS WITHIN SPECIES AND KIN-SELECTED COOPERATION BETWEEN SPECIES, GENERATING PROMISING DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.","[BARKER, JESSICA L.;; BRONSTEIN, JUDITH L.;] UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.; [BARKER, JESSICA L.;] AARHUS UNIV, AARHUS INST ADV STUDIES, DK-8000 AARHUS C, DENMARK.; [FRIESEN, MAREN L.;] MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.; [JONES, EMILY I.;] RICE UNIV, DEPT BIOSCI, HOUSTON, TX 77005 USA.; [REEVE, H.; KERN] CORNELL UNIV, DEPT NEUROBIOL & BEHAV, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.; [ZINK, ANDREW G.;] SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94132 USA.; [FREDERICKSON, MEGAN E.;] UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TORONTO, ON M5S 3B2, CANADA.;","10.1111/evo.13174","ARTICLE","NIHUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICESNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) - USA [5K12GM000708-13]; AARHUS INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED STUDIES-MARIE CURIE COFUND FELLOWSHIP; NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-1354155, DEB-1354878, IOS-1331218, DEB-1342793, IOS-1258133]; NSERC DISCOVERY GRANTNATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA; HUXLEY FELLOWSHIP AT THE RICE UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF BIOSCIENCES [FF-1473]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICESNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) - USANIH NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS) [K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708, K12GM000708] FUNDING SOURCE: NIH REPORTER; DIRECT FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCESNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1258133] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGYNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1342793] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION; DIVISION OF INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL SYSTEMSNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1258133] FUNDING SOURCE: NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION","THIS REVIEW AROSE FROM A SATELLITE SYMPOSIUM AT THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY MEETING.

THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THESE INTERACTIONS SHOW A STRONG CONTEXT-DEPENDENCY DIRECTLY RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN PARTNER IDENTITY AND DIFFERENTIAL STRENGTH. YET UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT-DEPENDENCY AND FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS ON INDIVIDUALS REMAINS A LASTING CHALLENGE. WE USE A NETWORK APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZE THE INDIVIDUAL, PLANT-BASED POLLINATION INTERACTION NETWORKS OF THE CANARIAN ISOPLEXIS CANARIENSIS (PLANTAGINACEAE) WITH A MIXED ASSEMBLAGE OF VERTEBRATE MUTUALISTS (BIRDS AND LIZARDS) AND INVERTEBRATE ANTAGONISTS (FLORIVORES, NECTAR LARCENISTS, AND PREDISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS). WE IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY INTERACTION TYPOLOGIES BASED ON THE SIGN (MUTUALISTIC VS. ANTAGONISTIC) AND STRENGTH (WEAK VS. STRONG) OF ANIMAL-MEDIATED POLLINATION AND TEST THE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIVIDUAL FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRS). IN ADDITION, WE DOCUMENT POLLINATOR MOVEMENT PATTERNS AMONG INDIVIDUAL PLANTS TO INFER EVENTS OF POLLEN TRANSFER/RECEIPT THAT DEFINE THE PLANT MATING NETWORKS AND TEST THE RELATIONSHIP WITH FRS. WE IDENTIFY SIX INTERACTION TYPOLOGIES ALONG A MUTUALISM-ANTAGONISM GRADIENT, WITH TWO TYPOLOGIES BEING OVER-REPRESENTED INVOLVING BOTH MUTUALISTS AND ANTAGONISTS AND INFLUENCING FRS. PLANTS SHOWING STRONG MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS, BUT ALSO (WEAK OR STRONG) INTERACTIONS WITH ANTAGONISTS ARE RELATIVELY BETTER CONNECTED IN THE MATING NETWORK (I.E., WITH HIGHER POTENTIAL TO TRANSFER OR RECEIVE POLLEN). THUS, MIXED FLOWER VISITOR ASSMBLAGES WITH MUTUALISTS AND ANTAGONISTS GIVE PLANTS INCREASED THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE MATING NETWOREKS, PROMOTE OUTCROSSING AND INCREASING BOTH FEMALE AND MALE FITNESS. OUR APPROACH HELPS CHARACTERIZE PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTION TYPOLOGIES, THE CONTEXT-SPECIFICITY OF DIVERSIFIED MUTUALISMS, AND A BETTER FORECASTING OF THEIR FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES.","[RODRIGUEZ-RODRIGUEZ, MARIA C.;; JORDANO, PEDRO; VALIDO, ALFREDO] ESTN BIOL DONANA EBD CSIC, DEPT INTEGRAT ECOL, C AMERICO VESPUCIO 26, SEVILLE 41092, SPAIN.;","10.1002/ecy.1756","ARTICLE","PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP [I3P I3PPRE_06_00019 CSIC]; POSTDOCTORAL GRANT [RYC-2007-00620]; JUNTA DE ANDALUCIA EXCELLENCE GRANTJUNTA DE ANDALUCIA [RNM-5731]; MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDADSPANISH GOVERNMENT [SEV-2012-0262]","WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR COMMENTS PROVIDED BY FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ-SANCHEZ AND JOHN N.

DESPITE THE ADVANTAGE OF CARRYING THESE MICROBES, THEY ARE TYPICALLY ONLY FOUND IN A FRACTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A POPULATION AND ARE OFTEN NON-RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG HOST POPULATIONS. IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR WHY FACULTATIVE SYMBIONTS ARE ONLY FOUND IN CERTAIN HOST INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS. HERE WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR A MECHANISM TO HELP EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON: THAT WHEN SYMBIONTS INTERACT WITH NON-NATIVE HOST GENOTYPES IT CAN LIMIT THE HORIZONTAL TRANSFER OF SYMBIONTS TO PARTICULAR HOST LINEAGES AND POPULATIONS OF RELATED HOSTS. RESULTS: USING RECIPROCAL TRANSFECTIONS OF THE FACULTATIVE SYMBIONT HAMILTONELLA DEFENSA INTO DIFFERENT PEA APHID CLONES, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PARTICULAR SYMBIONT STRAINS CAN CAUSE HIGH HOST MORTALITY AND INHIBIT OFFSPRING PRODUCTION WHEN INJECTED INTO APHID CLONES OTHER THAN THEIR NATIVE HOST LINEAGE. HOWEVER, ONCE ESTABLISHED, THE SYMBIONT'S ABILITY TO PROTECT AGAINST PARASITOIDS WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ITS ORIGIN. WE THEN DEMONSTRATE THAT H. DEFENSA IS ALSO MORE LIKELY TO ESTABLISH A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH APHID CLONES FROM A PLANT-ADAPTED POPULATION (BIOTYPE) THAT TYPICALLY CARRY H. DEFENSA IN NATURE, COMPARED TO CLONES FROM A BIOTYPE THAT DOES NOT NORMALLY CARRY THIS SYMBIONT. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT CERTAIN APHID LINEAGES AND POPULATIONS OF RELATED HOSTS ARE PREDISPOSED TO ESTABLISHING A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH H. DEFENSA. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT HOST-SYMBIONT GENOTYPE INTERACTIONS REPRESENT A POTENTIAL BARRIER TO HORIZONTAL TRANSMISSION THAT CAN LIMIT THE SPREAD OF SYMBIONTS, AND ADAPTIVE TRAITS THEY CARRY, TO CERTAIN HOST LINEAGES.","[NIEPOTH, NATALIE; ELLERS, JACINTHA; HENRY, LEE M.;] VRIJE UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT ECOL SCI, ANIM ECOL, DE BOELELAAN 1085, NL-1081 HV AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.; [NIEPOTH, NATALIE] COLUMBIA UNIV, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT & ENVIRONM BIOL, NEW YORK, NY USA.; [HENRY, LEE M.;] QUEEN MARY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL & CHEM SCI, MILE END RD, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND.;","10.1186/s12862-018-1143-z","ARTICLE","MARIE CURIE PROJECTEUROPEAN UNION (EU) [626616]; NERC FELLOWSHIPNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL [NE/M018016/1]; NETHERLANDS ORGANISATION FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, VICI GRANT [865.12.003]","THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY MARIE CURIE PROJECT 626616 AND NERC FELLOWSHIP NE/M018016/1.

DISTINCT FORAGING STRATEGIES MAY EMERGE WITHIN A POPULATION IN RESPONSE TO HETEROGENEOUS RESOURCES, COMPETITION AND LEARNING, AMONG OTHER DRIVERS. WE ASSESSED INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN, AND ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF, AN UNUSUAL, SPECIALIZED FORAGING TACTIC BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS. IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL, BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS, TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS, HERD FISH SCHOOLS TOWARDS ARTISANAL FISHERMEN, WHO CAST NETS IN RESPONSE TO BEHAVIOURAL CUES FROM THE DOLPHINS. THIS APPARENT COOPERATIVE TACTIC LIKELY INVOLVES COSTS AS WELL AS BENEFITS FOR BOTH INTERACTING PARTIES, BUT SUCH TRADE-OFFS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR DOLPHINS. WE SHOW THAT INDIVIDUAL DOLPHINS VARY MARKEDLY IN THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY INTERACT WITH FISHERMEN, AND THAT THIS FORAGING VARIATION IS LINKED TO RANGING BEHAVIOUR. NOT ALL INDIVIDUAL DOLPHINS INTERACT WITH FISHERMEN; THOSE THAT ROUTINELY DO SO CONCENTRATE AROUND THE LIMITED INTERACTION SITES AND HAVE SMALLER HOME RANGES THAN INDEPENDENT FORAGERS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FORAGING WITH FISHERMEN INCREASES FORAGING SUCCESS AND REDUCES SEARCH COSTS (I.E. FORAGING RANGE). COMPETITION FOR INTERACTION SITES MAY OFFSET SUCH BENEFITS, SINCE SOME INDIVIDUALS OFTEN FORAGE AT THE HIGH-QUALITY SITES WHILE OTHERS FORAGE AT LOW-QUALITY SITES. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT TWO ALTERNATIVE TACTICS EMERGE IN THE POPULATION FROM TRADE-OFFS INVOLVING FOOD ACCESS, FORAGING AREA, LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND COMPETITION: DOLPHINS EITHER FORAGE BY THEMSELVES OVER LARGER AREAS ON UNPREDICTABLE RESOURCE PATCHES (PASSING FISH SCHOOLS), OR LEARN TO INTERACT WITH FISHERMEN TO ACCESS AND COMPETE FOR MORE PREDICTABLE RESOURCE PATCHES (INTERACTION SITES). BY REVEALING SOME OF THE ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF THIS REMARKABLE HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTION, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TWO BROADER INSIGHTS. FIRST, SPECIALIZED FORAGING CAN HAVE RANGING CONSEQUENCES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SO STRUCTURE THE POPULATION SPATIALLY; SECOND, INTERSPECIFIC COOPERATION MAY BE FOUNDED UPON INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION.

IT IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN HOW INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN PSFS INTERACTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT (E.G., NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY) TO INFLUENCE COMPETITION BETWEEN NATIVE AND INVASIVE PLANTS. WE CONDUCTED A FULLY CROSSED MULTI-FACTOR GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS RHIZOSPHERE SOIL BIOTA, INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION, AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY ON BIOMASS OF REPLICATE POPULATIONS FROM ONE NATIVE AND TWO INVASIVE LINEAGES OF COMMON REED (P.AUSTRALIS) AND A SINGLE LINEAGE OF NATIVE SMOOTH CORDGRASS (SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA). HARMFUL SOIL BIOTA CONSISTENTLY DOMINATED PSFS INVOLVING ALL THREE P.AUSTRALIS LINEAGES, REDUCING BIOMASS BY 10%. INDIRECT PSFS (I.E., SOIL BIOTA SPILLOVER) FROM THE TWO INVASIVE P.AUSTRALIS LINEAGES REDUCED S.ALTERNIFLORA BIOMASS BY 7%, WHEREAS PSFS FROM THE NATIVE P.AUSTRALIS LINEAGE INCREASED S.ALTERNIFLORA BIOMASS BY 6%. INTERESTINGLY, INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AND PSFS INTERACTED TO WEAKEN THEIR RESPECTIVE IMPACTS ON S.ALTERNIFLORA, WHEREAS THEY EXERTED SYNERGISTIC NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON P.AUSTRALIS. PHRAGMITESAUSTRALIS SOIL BIOTA DECREASED S.ALTERNIFLORA BIOMASS WHEN GROWN ALONE (I.E., A SOIL LEGACY), BUT INCREASED S.ALTERNIFLORA BIOMASS WHEN GROWN WITH P.AUSTRALIS, SUGGESTING THAT P.AUSTRALIS RECRUITS HARMFUL GENERALIST SOIL BIOTA OR FACILITATES S.ALTERNIFLORA VIA SPILLOVER (I.E., APPARENT MUTUALISM). SOIL BIOTA ALSO REDUCED INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION IMPACTS ON S.ALTERNIFLORA, ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED COMPETITIVELY INFERIOR TO P.AUSTRALIS ACROSS ALL TREATMENTS. COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AND RESPONSES TO NUTRIENTS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG P.AUSTRALIS LINEAGES, INDICATING THAT INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AND NUTRIENT DEPOSITION MAY NOT BE KEY DRIVERS OF P.AUSTRALIS INVASION IN NORTH AMERICA. ALTHOUGH SOIL BIOTA, INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION, AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY APPEAR TO HAVE NO DIRECT IMPACT ON THE SUCCESS OF INVASIVE P.AUSTRALIS LINEAGES IN NORTH AMERICA, INTRASPECIFIC LINEAGE VARIATION IN INDIRECT SPILLOVER AND SOIL LEGACIES FROM P.AUSTRALIS OCCUR AND MAY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CO-OCCURRING NATIVE SPECIES AND RESTORATION OF INVADED HABITATS. OUR STUDY INTEGRATES MULTIPLE FACTORS LINKED TO PLANT INVASIONS, HIGHLIGHTING THAT INDIRECT INTERACTIONS ARE LIKELY COMMONPLACE IN INFLUENCING PLANT COMMUNITY DYNAMICS AND INVASION SUCCESS AND IMPACTS.","[ALLEN, WARWICK J.;; FLICK, ANDREW J.;; CRONIN, JAMES T.;] LOUISIANA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, BATON ROUGE, LA 70803 USA.; [ALLEN, WARWICK J.;] LINCOLN UNIV, BIOPROTECT RES CTR, POB 84, LINCOLN 7647, NEW ZEALAND.; [MEYERSON, LAURA A.;] UNIV RHODE ISL, NAT RESOURCES SCI, KINGSTON, RI 02881 USA.;","10.1002/ecy.2344","ARTICLE","NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB 1050084, DMS 1516833, DEB 1501775, DEB 1049914]; LOUISIANA ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION COMMISSION; SIGMA XI SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SOCIETY; LSU BIOGRADS","WE THANK THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT GRANTED PERMISSION TO COLLECT BULK SOIL: MACKAY ISLAND NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, PALM BEACH COUNTY PARKS DEPARTMENT, LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST, AND THOUSAND PALMS OASIS PRESERVE.

THIS PHENOMENON IS KNOWN AS INDIRECT GENETIC EFFECTS (IGES). IN AQUACULTURE SPECIES AND SOME PLANTS, HOWEVER, COMPETITION NOT ONLY AFFECTS TRAIT LEVELS OF INDIVIDUALS, BUT ALSO INFLATES VARIABILITY OF TRAIT VALUES AMONG INDIVIDUALS. IN THE FIELD OF QUANTITATIVE GENETICS, THE VARIABILITY OF TRAIT VALUES HAS BEEN STUDIED AS A QUANTITATIVE TRAIT IN ITSELF, AND IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS INHERITED VARIABILITY. SUCH STUDIES, HOWEVER, CONSIDER ONLY THE GENETIC EFFECT OF THE FOCAL INDIVIDUAL ON TRAIT VARIABILITY AND DO NOT MAKE A CONNECTION TO COMPETITION. ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVED PHENOTYPIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPETITION AND VARIABILITY SUGGESTS AN UNDERLYING GENETIC RELATIONSHIP, THE CURRENT QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODELS OF IGE AND INHERITED VARIABILITY DO NOT ALLOW FOR SUCH A RELATIONSHIP. THE LACK OF QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODELS THAT CONNECT IGES TO INHERITED VARIABILITY LIMITS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE POTENTIAL OF VARIABILITY TO RESPOND TO SELECTION, BOTH IN NATURE AND AGRICULTURE. MODELS OF TRAIT LEVELS, FOR EXAMPLE, SHOW THAT IGES MAY CONSIDERABLY CHANGE HERITABLE VARIATION IN TRAIT VALUES. CURRENTLY, WE LACK THE TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THIS RESULT EXTENDS TO VARIABILITY OF TRAIT VALUES. HERE WE PRESENT A MODEL THAT INTEGRATES IGES AND INHERITED VARIABILITY. IN THIS MODEL, THE TARGET PHENOTYPE, SAY GROWTH RATE, IS A FUNCTION OF THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF THE FOCAL INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE DIFFERENCE IN TRAIT VALUE BETWEEN THE SOCIAL PARTNER AND THE FOCAL INDIVIDUAL, MULTIPLIED BY A REGRESSION COEFFICIENT. THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENT IS A GENETIC TRAIT, WHICH IS A MEASURE OF COOPERATION; A NEGATIVE VALUE INDICATES COMPETITION, A POSITIVE VALUE COOPERATION, AND AN INCREASING VALUE DUE TO SELECTION INDICATES THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION. IN CONTRAST TO THE EXISTING QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODELS, OUR MODEL ALLOWS FOR CO-EVOLUTION OF IGES AND VARIABILITY, AS THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENT CAN RESPOND TO SELECTION. OUR SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT THE MODEL RESULTS IN INCREASED VARIABILITY OF BODY WEIGHT WITH INCREASING COMPETITION.

HERE WE REPLICATE OUR PREVIOUS WORK LOOKING AT SIX PAIRS OF CAPUCHIN MONKEYS' (SAPAJUS [CEBUS] APELLA) RESPONSES TO SCENARIOS REQUIRING BOTH COORDINATION (ASSURANCE GAME) AND ANTI-COORDINATION (HAWK-DOVE GAME). THIS THEN PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSING THEIR RESPONSES TO TWO ADDITIONAL GAMES, ONE WITH A SCENARIO OF BENEFICIAL COOPERATION WITH A TEMPTATION TO DEFECT (PRISONER'S DILEMMA) AND ONE WITH AN ENVIRONMENT REQUIRING CHANGING STRATEGIES WITHIN SHORT TEMPORAL PROXIMITY (ALTERNATING ECONOMIC GAME). WE ADDITIONALLY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF EXOGENOUS OXYTOCIN ON DECISION-MAKING. OXYTOCIN DID NOT AFFECT DECISIONS IN ANY OF OUR GAMES. RESULTS FROM THE FIRST TWO GAMES LARGELY REPLICATED OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS. RESPONSES TO THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA WERE MORE VARIED THAN WAS SEEN IN PREVIOUS GAMES, WITH PAIRS RESPECTIVELY COOPERATING, DEFECTING, AND FAILING TO ESTABLISH STABLE STRATEGIES. SUCH VARIABILITY INDICATES THAT THIS GAME MAY BE A GOOD ASSAY FOR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL DECISION-MAKING. FINALLY, CAPUCHINS WERE ABLE TO FLEXIBLY SWITCH BETWEEN THEIR PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED STRATEGIES WITHIN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT GAMES, EVEN WHEN THE GAMES WERE PRESENTED WITHIN THE SAME SESSION, REQUIRING STRATEGY ADJUSTMENTS WITHIN SHORT TEMPORAL PROXIMITY. THESE RESULTS BUILD ON EARLIER FINDINGS SHOWING THAT CAPUCHINS CAN ALTER DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES AS THE CONTEXT DEMANDS, WHICH IS LIKELY ESSENTIAL FOR DECISION-MAKING IN NATURALLY OCCURRING CONTEXTS.","[SMITH, MACKENZIE F.;; BROSNAN, SARAH F.;] GEORGIA STATE UNIV, DEPT PSYCHOL, ATLANTA, GA 30302 USA.; [SMITH, MACKENZIE F.;; LEVERETT, KELLY L.;; BROSNAN, SARAH F.;] GEORGIA STATE UNIV, LANGUAGE RES CTR, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA.; [WILSON, BART J.;] CHAPMAN UNIV, ECON SCI INST, ORANGE, CA USA.; [WILSON, BART J.;] CHAPMAN UNIV, SMITH INST POLIT ECON & PHILOSOPHY, ORANGE, CA USA.; [BROSNAN, SARAH F.;] GEORGIA STATE UNIV, NEUROSCI INST, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA.; [BROSNAN, SARAH F.;] GEORGIA STATE UNIV, CTR BEHAV NEUROSCI, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA.;","10.1002/ajp.22973","ARTICLE","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [SES 1123897]; JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION; NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)","NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: SES 1123897; JOHN TEMPLETON FOUNDATION; NSF","4","AM J PRIMATOL","AM.

SOCIAL NETWORK THEORY PREDICTS THAT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE TRANSITIVE; THUS, THE FRIEND OF A FRIEND IS MORE LIKELY TO BE A FRIEND. FURTHER, WHEN CONSIDERING BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS JOINTLY, STRUCTURAL BALANCE THEORY PREDICTS THAT CERTAIN CONFIGURATIONS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS IN A TRIAD ARE INHERENTLY LESS STABLE (UNBALANCED) AND SHOULD TEND TO BE ELIMINATED. HOWEVER, STRUCTURAL BALANCE HAS BEEN RARELY EXAMINED IN NONHUMAN SOCIAL SYSTEMS. WE TESTED FOR TRANSITIVITY AND STRUCTURAL BALANCE IN SOCIAL NETWORKS OF SOCIALLY FLEXIBLE YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS (MARMOTA FLAVIVENTER) AND ASKED IF GROUP SIZE, NETWORK DENSITY, OR GROUP COMPOSITION AFFECTED THE DEGREE OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE. WE FOUND A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSITIVITY IN POSITIVE INTERACTIONS, SOME TRANSITIVITY IN NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS, AND SOME EVIDENCE OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE. IN PARTICULAR, A WEAK DEFINITION OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE IS PROBABLY MORE COMMON THAN STRONG STRUCTURAL BALANCE, WHICH USED A STRICTER DEFINITION OF BALANCE. NETWORK SIZE LIMITED THE ABILITY TO DETECT THESE SOCIAL PROCESSES, AND SMALLER NETWORKS WERE LESS LIKELY TO SHOW SIGNIFICANT TRANSITIVITY OR STRUCTURAL BALANCE. THE PROPORTION OF ADULT FEMALES IN A GROUP AFFECTED THE LEVEL OF TRANSITIVITY BUT DID NOT AFFECT THE DEGREE OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE INTRIGUING SIMILARITIES IN SOCIAL PROCESSES ACROSS DIVERSE ANIMAL SOCIETIES AND THAT STUDYING TRIADS AND NETWORK MOTIFS MAY HELP IDENTIFY BASIC SOCIAL MECHANISMS LINKING LOCAL TO GLOBAL STRUCTURE.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSOCIAL NETWORK THEORY PREDICTS THAT BASIC SOCIAL MECHANISMS SHOULD LEAD TO SIMILAR STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES ACROSS DIFFERENT SOCIETIES. FOR EXAMPLE, POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD BE TRANSITIVE (A FRIEND OF A FRIEND IS A FRIEND), AND CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS REPRESENT CONFLICT AND SHOULD BE UNSTABLE OVER TIME (E.G., A FRIEND OF A FRIEND BEING AN ENEMY IS AN UNSTABLE STATE). THIS LATTER THEORY, CALLED STRUCTURAL BALANCE, HAS RARELY BEEN EXAMINED IN NONHUMAN SOCIETIES; HENCE, WE TESTED FOR TRANSITIVITY AND STRUCTURAL BALANCE IN GROUPS OF FREE-LIVING YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS. POSITIVE INTERACTIONS WERE GENERALLY TRANSITIVE, BUT EVIDENCE FOR STRUCTURAL BALANCE WAS INCONSISTENT. FURTHERMORE, GROUP COMPOSITION COULD AFFECT NETWORK TRANSITIVITY, AND SMALL NETWORK SIZE (ASSOCIATED WITH FEW INTERACTIONS) LIMITS ABILITY TO DETECT SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TRANSITIVITY IS FUNDAMENTAL IN STRUCTURING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS, WHILE SOME FORMS OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE ARE PRESENT BUT NOT WIDESPREAD.","[WEY, TINA W.;] UNIV SHERBROOKE, DEPT FAMILY MED & EMERGENCY MED, 3001,12E AVE NORD, SHERBROOKE, PQ J1H 5N4, CANADA.; [WEY, TINA W.;; BLUMSTEIN, DANIEL T.;] UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES, DEPT ECOL & EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, 621 YOUNG DR SOUTH, LOS ANGELES, CA 90095 USA.; [JORDAN, FERENC] HUNGARIAN ACAD SCI, MTA CTR ECOL RES, KAROLINA UT 29, H-1113 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY.; [JORDAN, FERENC] UNIV TRENTO, MICROSOFT RES, CTR COMPUTAT & SYST BIOL, PIAZZA MANIFATTURA 1, I-38068 ROVERETO, ITALY.; [BLUMSTEIN, DANIEL T.;] ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, POB 519, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;","10.1007/s00265-019-2699-3","ARTICLE","U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GRADUATE ASSISTANCE IN AREAS OF NATIONAL NEED FELLOWSHIPUS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GK-12 FELLOWSHIPNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF); UCLA CHANCELLOR'S PRIZE; ROCKY MOUNTAIN BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY (RMBL) SNYDER GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETYNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY [8140-06]; UCLA FACULTY SENATE AND DIVISION OF LIFE SCIENCES; RMBL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [IDBR-0754247, DEB-1119660, 1557130, DBI 0242960, 0731346]; NATIONAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION OFFICE (NKFIH GRANT) [OTKA K 11607]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION GRADUATE ASSISTANCE IN AREAS OF NATIONAL NEED FELLOWSHIP, A NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GK-12 FELLOWSHIP, A UCLA CHANCELLOR'S PRIZE, AND A ROCKY MOUNTAIN BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY (RMBL) SNYDER GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP (TO TWW); BY THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (GRANT NO. 8140-06), THE UCLA FACULTY SENATE AND DIVISION OF LIFE SCIENCES, AND A RMBL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP (TO DTB); BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (IDBR-0754247, DEB-1119660, AND 1557130 TO DTB; DBI 0242960 AND 0731346 TO THE RMBL); AND BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION OFFICE (NKFIH GRANT OTKA K 11607 TO FJ).","6","BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL","BEHAV.

HERE, WE DESCRIBE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SIRICID WOODWASPS, THEIR FUNGAL SYMBIONTS AND PARASITIC NEMATODES AND SHOW HOW DEFENSE BY SYMBIONTS IN THIS SYSTEM IS ALSO CONTEXT-DEPENDENT. THE SPECIES OR STRAIN OF THE WHITE ROT FUNGUS USED AS A SYMBIONT BY SIREX CAN INFLUENCE PARASITISM OF THESE HOSTS BY DELADENUS NEMATODES.","[HAJEK, ANN E.;] CORNELL UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.; [MORRIS, ELIZABETH ERIN] UNIV NEW HAMPSHIRE, DEPT BIOL SCI, DURHAM, NH 03823 USA.; [HENDRY, TORY A.;] CORNELL UNIV, DEPT MICROBIOL, ITHACA, NY 14853 USA.;","10.1016/j.cois.2019.03.006","REVIEW","USDA FOREST SERVICEUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE","WE THANK DR MELANIE SMEE FOR COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ON EARLY VERSIONS OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND DR SANA GARDESCU FOR ASSISTANCE WITH FIGURES.

THIS CONFLICT CAN BE MEDIATED BY FOOD THAT INCREASES MUTUAL BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF SEXUAL COOPERATION INVOLVING FOOD IS BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON MATING SYSTEMS WITH MALE FOOD CONTROL, RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED UNIVERSAL FEMALE FOOD CONTROL ACROSS TAXA. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO EMPIRICAL STUDIES TESTING FOOD'S ROLE IN FACILITATING SEXUAL COOPERATION IN THIS SCENARIO. HERE, WE EXAMINED THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD AVAILABILITY AND MATING IN THE PEA LEAFMINER, LIRIOMYZA HUIDOBRENSIS, THE MALES OF WHICH FEED ON THE EXUDATES FROM THE LEAF PUNCTURES CREATED BY FEMALE OVIPOSITORS. GIVEN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FEMALE OVIPOSITION AND FOOD PRODUCTION, WE INFER THAT FOOD CONTROLLED BY FEMALES MAY ALTER MALE OPTIMA IN MATING AND THUS MODULATE MALE COURTSHIP STRATEGIES FOR MATING. MATING STIMULATED FEMALES TO PRODUCE ABUNDANT PUNCTURES, WHICH BENEFITED MALE FEEDING AND SURVIVAL. WHEN MALES WERE DEPRIVED OF THE PUNCTURES, THEY ADOPTED AN ELABORATE DANCING BEHAVIOUR, LEADING TO INCREASED RECEPTIVITY OF FEMALES. HOWEVER, WHEN MALES ADOPTED AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY OF DIRECTLY APPROACHING FEMALES, THEY OBTAINED FEWER PUNCTURES. AFTER PREFERENTIAL MATING WITH DANCING MALES, FEMALES SIGNIFICANTLY PROLONGED THEIR LIFE SPAN AND INCREASED OFFSPRING NUMBERS. SEXUAL COOPERATION IN LEAFMINERS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT EXUDATES, WHICH WE FOUND CONTAIN ABUNDANT SUGARS AND AMINO ACIDS. THE PLANT EXUDATES ARE VITAL FOOD FOR MALES, BUT THEIR NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND AVAILABILITY RAPIDLY DECLINED WITH TIME. OUR STUDY REVEALS THAT THE FOOD PRODUCED BY FEMALES CAN PROVIDE MUTUAL BENEFITS TO MALE SURVIVAL AND FEMALE REPRODUCTION. OUR STUDY OF FOOD CONTROL BY FEMALES EXTENDS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EVOLUTION IN SEXUAL COOPERATION.  2019 THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR","STATE KEY LABORATORY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF PEST INSECTS AND RODENTS AND KEY LABORATORY OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY, CONSERVATIONAL BIOLOGY, INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF PEST INSECTS AND RODENTS AND KEY LABORATORY OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY, CONSERVATIONAL BIOLOGY, INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF PEST INSECTS AND RODENTS AND KEY LABORATORY OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY, CONSERVATIONAL BIOLOGY, INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA;STATE KEY LABORATORY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF PEST INSECTS AND RODENTS AND KEY LABORATORY OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY, CONSERVATIONAL BIOLOGY, INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA, BEIJING INSTITUTES OF LIFE SCIENCE, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BEIJING, CHINA","10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.01.001","ARTICLE","2017YFD0200400

BEHAV., 89, PP. 115-122","IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT PARASITES CAN HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF HOST ORGANISMS, AND THAT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOUR CAN INFLUENCE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PARASITE INFECTIONS. RECENTLY, TWO MAJOR THEMES OF RESEARCH HAVE DEVELOPED. FIRST, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN THE PROXIMATE, MECHANISTIC PROCESSES UNDERPINNING PARASITE-ASSOCIATED BEHAVIOUR CHANGE, AND THE INTERACTIVE ROLES OF THE NEURO-, IMMUNE, AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IN DETERMINING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BEHAVIOUR AND INFECTION SUSCEPTIBILITY. SECONDLY, AS THE STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR HAS SHIFTED AWAY FROM ONE-OFF MEASUREMENTS OF SINGLE BEHAVIOURS AND TOWARDS A BEHAVIOURAL SYNDROMES/PERSONALITY FRAMEWORK, RESEARCH IS STARTING TO FOCUS ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARASITE INFECTION FOR TEMPORAL AND CONTEXTUAL CONSISTENCY OF BEHAVIOUR, AND ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENT PERSONALITY TYPES FOR INFECTION SUSCEPTIBILITY. IN ADDITION, THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN THE POTENTIAL FOR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COGNITION AND PERSONALITY TO ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR HOST-PARASITE INTERACTIONS. AS MODELS WELL-SUITED TO BOTH THE LABORATORY STUDY OF BEHAVIOUR AND EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY, TELEOST FISH HAVE BEEN USED AS HOSTS IN MANY OF THESE STUDIES. IN THIS REVIEW WE PROVIDE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE RANGE OF MECHANISMS THAT POTENTIALLY GENERATE LINKS BETWEEN FISH BEHAVIOUR, PERSONALITY, AND PARASITISM, AND ILLUSTRATE THESE USING EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM THE RECENT LITERATURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COGNITION, PERSONALITY AND PARASITISM, AND IDENTIFY QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE USEFULLY INVESTIGATED WITH FISH MODELS.  2016 ELSEVIER B.V.","DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOUR, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND PSYCHOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER, LEICESTER, LE1 7RH, UNITED KINGDOM;DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS, DAVIS, CA, UNITED STATES;DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS, DAVIS, CA, UNITED STATES;BIOSCIENCES DEPARTMENT, RICE UNIVERSITY, HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES;DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS, DAVIS, CA, UNITED STATES","10.1016/j.beproc.2016.11.012","REVIEW","","","","BEHAV PROCESSES","BEHAV.

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SPECIES IS THAT MALE AGGRESSION IS MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE IN MALE-DOMINATED CHIMPANZEES THAN IN BONOBOS, WHERE THE HIGHEST-RANKING INDIVIDUALS ARE FEMALE [1]. ONE POTENTIAL EXPLANATION IS THAT BECAUSE PERIODS OF FEMALE SEXUAL RECEPTIVITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS ARE MORE EXTENDED IN BONOBOS [2], MALES COMPETE LESS INTENSELY FOR EACH MATING OPPORTUNITY. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE STRENGTH OF SELECTION FOR TRAITS THAT LEAD TO SUCCESS IN DIRECT CONTEST COMPETITION BETWEEN MALES AND IN SEXUAL COERCION OF FEMALES, THUS INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR FEMALE CHOICE [3]. ACCORDINGLY, IT HAS BEEN PREDICTED THAT THE INFLUENCE OF MALE DOMINANCE RANK ON REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND THE EXTENT OF MALE REPRODUCTIVE SKEW SHOULD BE LOWER IN BONOBOS THAN IN CHIMPANZEES [1]. ALTHOUGH RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNUSUAL LEVELS OF EGALITARIANISM AND COOPERATION FOUND IN HUMAN HUNTER-GATHERERS [4], COMPARATIVE ANALYSES IN THE GENUS PAN HAVE BEEN LIMITED BY THE SCANTY PATERNITY DATA AVAILABLE FOR WILD BONOBOS [5]. HERE, WE SHOW USING THE LARGEST SAMPLE OF PATERNITY DATA AVAILABLE THAT, CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, MALE BONOBOS HAVE A HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE SKEW AND A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOMINANCE RANK AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS THAN CHIMPANZEES.  2017 ELSEVIER LTD","PRIMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY, LEIPZIG, 04103, GERMANY;SCHOOL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION AND SOCIAL CHANGE, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE, AZ  85281, UNITED STATES, INSTITUTE OF HUMAN ORIGINS, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, TEMPE, AZ  85281, UNITED STATES;CENTRE FOR RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION, ROYAL ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF ANTWERP, ANTWERP, 2018, BELGIUM, SCHOOL OF NATURAL SCIENCES AND PSYCHOLOGY, LIVERPOOL JOHN MOORES UNIVERSITY, LIVERPOOL, L3 3AF, UNITED KINGDOM;PRIMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY, LEIPZIG, 04103, GERMANY;PRIMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY, LEIPZIG, 04103, GERMANY","10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.039","LETTER","NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,NIA: R01AG049395","","13","CURR BIOL","CURR.

TURN-TAKING IN COMMON MURRES (URIA AALGE) INVOLVES THE FORAGING BIRD RETURNING TO THE COLONY TO PROVISION THE CHICK AND THE BROODING PARENT DEPARTING. WE EXAMINED WHETHER COMMON MURRES IN POOR CONDITION HAD SLOWER OR MORE IRREGULAR TURN-TAKING BEHAVIOR, AS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN COMMON MURRES EQUIPPED WITH GEOLOGGERS. IRREGULARITIES INCLUDE THE BROODING BIRD NOT TRADING PARENTAL ROLES WITH ITS RETURNING MATE OR A BIRD RETURNING TO THE COLONY WITHOUT A FISH. IRREGULAR TURN-TAKING SEQUENCES GENERALLY TOOK LONGER THAN NORMAL TURN-TAKING SEQUENCES AND DIFFERED IN THE RATE AND SYNCHRONY OF ALLOPREENING, THE MAIN INTERACTIVE BEHAVIOR BETWEEN MATES. THERE WAS A DELAYED ONSET OF ALLOPREENING WHEN NEST RELIEFS WERE PROTRACTED, WHEREAS RETURNERS THAT DID NOT BRING A FISH STARTED ALLOPREENING SOONER THAN EITHER THEIR BROODING PARTNERS OR OTHER RETURNERS THAT BROUGHT A FISH. COMMON MURRES IN BETTER CONDITION (HIGHER BODY MASS AND LOWER LIPID METABOLITE LEVELS) LEFT THE COLONY SOONER AFTER THEIR RETURNING MATES FED THE CHICK COMPARED TO COMMON MURRES IN WORSE CONDITION. BIRDS WITH HIGHER CHICK-FEEDING RATES BROUGHT FISH BACK IN MORE VISITS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE WERE HIGHER-QUALITY BIRDS. WHEN BIRDS VARY IN THEIR TURN-TAKING CEREMONIAL BEHAVIORS, THEY MAY BE NEGOTIATING BY PROVIDING THEIR PARTNERS WITH CUES ABOUT THEIR CONDITION. SINCE COMMON MURRES HAVE LONG-TERM PAIR BONDS AND BOTH PARENTS ARE NECESSARY TO RAISE OFFSPRING, MATES SHOULD RESPOND TO INFORMATION FROM THEIR PARTNERS IF THEY CAN DO SO WITHOUT COMPROMISING THEIR OWN CONDITION BEYOND A CRITICAL THRESHOLD.  2017 AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGICAL SOCIETY.","COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY GRADUATE PROGRAM, MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY, ST.

MALE COALITION FORMATION CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY TO ONE-ON-ONE COMPETITION TO MAXIMIZE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. HERE WE FOCUS ON AGE AS A STATE VARIABLE TO EXPLAIN WITHIN-GROUP VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL PROPENSITY TO FORM COALITIONS AGAINST OTHER GROUP MEMBERS. WE SPECIFICALLY TEST THE PREDICTION THAT MALES CONDITIONALLY SWITCH FROM A SOLO STRATEGY FOR ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH MATING SUCCESS TO A COOPERATIVE STRATEGY AFTER REACHING POST-PRIME AGE IN MALE BARBARY MACAQUES (MACACA SYLVANUS). WE COMBINED NEW OBSERVATIONS WITH DATA COLLECTED IN 2006 AND 2008 ON THE SAME INDIVIDUALS FROM ONE CAPTIVE GROUP LIVING IN SEMI-NATURAL CONDITIONS AT AFFENBERG SALEM, GERMANY, AND FOUND THAT IN ALL YEARS MALES BETWEEN 5 AND 13 YEARS FORMED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER COALITIONS THAN MALES 14 YEARS AND OLDER (POST-PRIME). MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE FOUND THOSE MALES THAT AGED INTO THE POST-PRIME PHASE TO HAVE SWITCHED THEIR REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY AND TO FORM SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COALITIONS IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2008. THESE FIRST LONGITUDINAL DATA TOGETHER WITH EARLIER CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES IN THIS AND OTHER PRIMATE SPECIES SUGGEST THAT GROUP-LEVEL MEASURES OF COALITION PROPENSITY MAY BE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE AGE COMPOSITION OF GROUPS AND THAT MALE COALITION FORMATION CAN BE A CONDITIONAL REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY.

THE PRESENCE OF JUST ONE OR A FEW KEYSTONE INDIVIDUALS, SUCH AS LEADERS OR TUTORS, MAY HAVE A LARGE EFFECT ON COLLECTIVE OUTCOMES. THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN CATALYZE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN OTHER GROUP MEMBERS, THUS ALTERING GROUP COMPOSITION AND COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR. THE INFLUENCE OF KEYSTONE INDIVIDUALS ON GROUP FUNCTION MAY LEAD TO TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL SITUATIONS, BECAUSE THE BEHAVIORAL COMPOSITION THEY FACILITATE MAY BE SUITABLE IN ONE SITUATION BUT NOT ANOTHER. WE USE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS TO EXAMINE VARIOUS MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW KEYSTONE INDIVIDUALS TO EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE ON GROUP MEMBERS. WE FURTHER DISCUSS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN TWO POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING COLLECTIVE OUTCOMES, COOPERATIVE PREY ATTACK AND DISEASE DYNAMICS. OUR SIMULATIONS MATCH EMPIRICAL DATA FROM A SOCIAL SPIDER SYSTEM AND PRODUCE TESTABLE PREDICTIONS FOR THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE INFLUENCE OF KEYSTONE INDIVIDUALS ON GROUP COMPOSITION AND COLLECTIVE OUTCOMES. WE FIND THAT A GROUPS BEHAVIORAL COMPOSITION CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE KEYSTONE INDIVIDUAL THROUGH CHANGES TO INTERACTION PATTERNS OR BEHAVIORAL PERSISTENCE OVER TIME.

LOSING THE ABILITY TO PERFORM SUCH FUNCTIONS CAN BE ADVANTAGEOUS DUE TO COST SAVINGS, BUT WHEN THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH, ORGANISMS BECOME DEPENDENT ON ECOLOGICAL PARTNERS TO COMPENSATE FOR THOSE LOSSES. WHEN MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS MAY BE LOST, THE ECOLOGICAL OUTCOMES ARE POTENTIALLY DIVERSE, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT ORGANISMS ONLY; ONE-WAY DEPENDENCY, WHERE ONE PARTNER PERFORMS ALL FUNCTIONS AND OTHERS NONE; OR MUTUAL INTERDEPENDENCY WHERE PARTNERS PERFORM COMPLEMENTARY ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. WHAT DRIVES THESE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES? WE DEVELOP A MODEL WHERE ORGANISMS PERFORM 'LEAKY' FUNCTIONS THAT PROVIDE BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC BENEFITS TO EXPLORE THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATIZATION LEVEL, COSTS AND ESSENTIALITY ON INFLUENCING THESE OUTCOMES. WE SHOW THAT MUTUAL INTERDEPENDENCY IS FAVOURED AT INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OF PRIVATIZATION FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CONDITIONS. ONE-WAY DEPENDENCY, IN CONTRAST, IS ONLY FAVOURED WHEN PRIVATIZATION IS LOW AND LOSS-OF-FUNCTION BENEFITS ARE ACCELERATING. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN PRIVATIZATION LEVEL AND SHAPE OF BENEFITS FROM LOSS IN DRIVING MICROBIAL DEPENDENCIES. GIVEN THE UBIQUITY OF MICROBIAL FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INEVITABLY LEAKED AND THE EASE OF MUTATIONAL INACTIVATION, OUR FINDINGS MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY MICROBIAL INTERDEPENDENCIES ARE COMMON IN NATURE.  2016 SOCIETY FOR APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.","DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY AND BEACON CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION IN ACTION, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE, WA  98195, UNITED STATES;DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM, BIRMINGHAM, AL  35294, UNITED STATES, BEACON CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION IN ACTION, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY, EAST LANSING, MI  48824, UNITED STATES;DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY AND BEACON CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION IN ACTION, UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, SEATTLE, WA  98195, UNITED STATES","10.1111/1462-2920.13028","ARTICLE","","","5","ENVIRON MICROBIOL","ENVIRON.

WE USED A RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION SURFACE APPROXIMATION SUBJECT TO MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH CONSTRAINT TO UNCOVER THE STATE-SPACE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS FROM TIME SERIES DATA. THIS APPROXIMATION ALLOWED US TO INFER STRUCTURE FROM A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF THE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR OF SHEEP AND RED DEER, AND THE EFFECT OF DENSITY, THERMAL STRESS AND VEGETATION TYPE. ANIMAL MOVEMENT WAS RECORDED USING GPS COLLARS DEPLOYED IN SHEEP AND DEER GRAZING A LARGE EXPERIMENTAL PLOT IN WINTER AND SUMMER. INFORMATION ON THE THERMAL STRESS TO WHICH ANIMALS WERE EXPOSED WAS ESTIMATED USING THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF MECHANICAL HEATED MODELS AND METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS OF A NETWORK OF STATIONS IN THE PLOT. THERMAL STRESS WAS HIGHER IN DEER THAN IN SHEEP, WITH LESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES IN SUMMER. DEER TRAVELLED MORE DISTANCE THAN SHEEP, AND BOTH SPECIES TRAVELLED MORE IN SUMMER THAN IN WINTER; DEER TRAVEL DISTANCE SHOWED LESS SEASONAL DIFFERENCES THAN SHEEP. ANIMAL MOVEMENT WAS BETTER PREDICTED IN DEER THAN IN SHEEP AND IN WINTER THAN IN SUMMER; BOTH SPECIES SHOWED A SWARMING BEHAVIOUR IN GROUP COHESION, STRONGER IN DEER. AT SHORTER SEPARATION DISTANCES SWARMING REPULSION WAS STRONGER BETWEEN SPECIES THAN WITHIN SPECIES. AT LONGER SEPARATION DISTANCES INTER-SPECIFIC ATTRACTION WAS WEAKER THAN INTRA-SPECIFIC; THERE WAS A POSITIVE DENSITY-DEPENDENT EFFECT ON SWARMING, AND STRONGER IN DEER THAN IN SHEEP. THERE WAS NOT CLEAR EVIDENCE WHICH SPECIES ATTRACTED OR REPELLED THE OTHER; ATTRACTION BETWEEN DEER AT LONG SEPARATION DISTANCES WAS STRONGER WHEN THE MODEL ACCOUNTED FOR THERMAL STRESS, BUT IN GENERAL THE DYNAMIC MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR WAS HARDLY AFFECTED BY THE THERMAL STRESS. VEGETATION TYPE AFFECTED INTRA-SPECIES INTERACTIONS BUT HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON INTER-SPECIES INTERACTIONS. OUR MODELLING APPROACH IS USEFUL IN INTERPRETING ANIMAL INTERACTIONS, IN ORDER TO UNRAVEL COMPLEX COOPERATIVE OR COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOURS, AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IS THE FIRST MODELLING ATTEMPT TO MAKE PREDICTIONS OF MULTI-SPECIES ANIMAL MOVEMENT UNDER DIFFERENT HABITAT MOSAICS AND ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.  2015 PREZ-BARBERA ET AL.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES CAN VARY FROM MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO EVOLUTIONARILY NEUTRAL TO ANTAGONISTIC, EVEN WHEN THE SAME TWO SPECIES ARE INVOLVED. SIMILARLY, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE SAME SPECIES CAN LIE ON A SPECTRUM FROM CONFLICT TO COOPERATION. 2. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER VARIATION IN THE TWO TYPES OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR ARE INTERCONNECTED. IS THE FITNESS OF THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF SOCIAL PARTNER WITHIN SPECIES (SUCH AS PARENT AND OFFSPRING, OR MALE AND FEMALE) DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY INTERACTIONS WITH A SECOND SPECIES? MOREOVER, CAN INTER-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITHIN SPECIES? 3. THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTS FOCUS ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE BURYING BEETLE NICROPHORUS VESPILLOIDES HERBST AND THE PHORETIC MITE POECILOCHIRUS CARABI G. CANESTRINI & R. CANESTRINI. THE APPROACH WAS TO MEASURE THE FITNESS OF BURYING BEETLE MOTHERS, FATHERS, AND OFFSPRING AFTER REPRODUCTION, WHICH TOOK PLACE EITHER IN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF MITES. 4. WE FOUND THAT MALE, FEMALE, AND LARVAL BURYING BEETLES DERIVE CONTRASTING FITNESS COSTS AND BENEFITS FROM THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE MITE, DESPITE SHARING A COMMON FAMILY ENVIRONMENT. FROM THE MITE'S PERSPECTIVE, ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BURYING BEETLE CAN, THEREFORE, BE SIMULTANEOUSLY ANTAGONISTIC, NEUTRAL, AND POSSIBLY EVEN MUTUALISTIC, DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR FAMILY MEMBER INVOLVED. WE ALSO FOUND THAT MITES CAN POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF EVOLUTIONARY CONFLICTS WITHIN THE FAMILY. 5. WE CONCLUDE THAT INTER-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS CAN EXPLAIN SOME OF THE VARIATION IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SEEN WITHIN SPECIES. IT IS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT INTRA-SPECIFIC INTERACTIONS MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO VARIATION IN THE OUTCOME OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES.  2015 THE ROYAL ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY.","DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM;DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, CAMBRIDGE, UNITED KINGDOM","10.1111/een.12259","ARTICLE","SEVENTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME,FP7: 310785","","6","ECOL ENTOMOL","ECOL.

THEORETICAL STUDIES ON THE EVOLUTION OF HELPING AND HARMING BEHAVIORS HAVE LARGELY FOCUSED UPON GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, NONGENETIC VARIATION BETWEEN GROUP MEMBERS IS WIDESPREAD IN NATURAL POPULATIONS, AND MAY MEDIATE DIFFERENCES IN INDIVIDUALS' SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. HERE, WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK TO STUDY HOW VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL QUALITY MEDIATES THE EVOLUTION OF UNCONDITIONAL AND CONDITIONAL SOCIAL TRAITS. WE INVESTIGATE THE SCOPE FOR THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL TRAITS THAT ARE CONDITIONAL ON THE QUALITY OF THE ACTOR AND/OR RECIPIENTS. WE FIND THAT ASYMMETRIES IN INDIVIDUAL QUALITY CAN LEAD TO THE EVOLUTION OF PLASTIC TRAITS WITH DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSING HELPING AND HARMING TRAITS WITHIN THE SAME GROUP. IN THIS CONTEXT, POPULATION VISCOSITY CAN MEDIATE THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL TRAITS, AND LOCAL COMPETITION CAN PROMOTE BOTH HELPING AND HARMING BEHAVIORS. FURTHERMORE, ASYMMETRIES IN INDIVIDUAL QUALITY CAN LEAD TO THE EVOLUTION OF COMPETITION-LIKE TRAITS BETWEEN CLONAL INDIVIDUALS. OVERALL, WE HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF ASYMMETRIES IN INDIVIDUAL QUALITY, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE VALUE AND THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, IN MEDIATING THE EVOLUTION OF HELPING AND HARMING BEHAVIORS  2013 THE SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION.","DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, SOUTH PARKS ROAD, OXFORD OX1 3PS, UNITED KINGDOM;DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, SOUTH PARKS ROAD, OXFORD OX1 3PS, UNITED KINGDOM, BALLIOL COLLEGE, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BROAD STREET, OXFORD OX1 3BJ, UNITED KINGDOM","10.1111/evo.12110","ARTICLE","","","8","EVOLUTION","EVOLUTION","ENGLISH",2013,"RODRIGUES, A.M.M.; DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, SOUTH PARKS ROAD, OXFORD OX1 3PS, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: ANTONIO.RODRIGUES@ZOO.OX.AC.UK","EVOLUTION",15,"EVOLUTION OF HELPING AND HARMING IN HETEROGENEOUS GROUPS","2-S2.0-84880844765","67","ISI","UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;NOTREPORTED",NA,"RODRIGUES AMM, 2013, EVOLUTION","RODRIGUES AMM, 2013, EVOLUTION"

WE FOUND THAT THAT QUEEN SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY DIVERSE, RESULTING IN THREE DISTINCT COLONY SOCIAL SYSTEMS DISTRIBUTED IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARISE FROM VARIATION IN QUEEN BEHAVIOURS AT TWO DISTINCT TIMES IN THE COLONY LIFE CYCLE, AND ARE LIKELY TO RESULT FROM UNDERLYING GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGIONS. RESULTS FROM OUR POPULATION GENETICS ANALYSES AND THE BIOGEOGRAPHY OF THE MOJAVE AND SONORAN DESERTS SUGGEST THAT THE DIFFERENT QUEEN SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS MAY HAVE EVOLVED IN PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED POPULATIONS, WITH THEIR CURRENT DISTRIBUTIONS EXPLAINED IN PART BY SUBSEQUENT RANGE EXPANSIONS RATHER THAN LOCAL ADAPTATION IN SITU. HOWEVER, REGIONS WITH ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL FORMS CURRENTLY MEET IN CONTACT ZONES WHERE GENE FLOW AND NATURAL SELECTION ON ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL SYSTEMS SHOULD OCCUR.

IN THIS STUDY, AN INTEGRATIVE CULTURE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE A RICH FUNGAL CONSORTIUM FROM THE CONIFER ABIES BESHANZUENSIS. RESULTS INDICATE AN IMPRESSIVE DIVERSITY OF FUNGAL LINEAGES (A TOTAL OF 84 TAXA CLASSIFIED IN DIKARYA) AND A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION OF HITHERTO UNKNOWN SPECIES (27.4. %). THE LACCASE GENE WAS USED AS A FUNCTIONAL MARKER DUE TO ITS INVOLVEMENT IN LIGNOCELLULOSE DEGRADATION. REMARKABLE DIVERSITY OF LACCASE GENES WAS FOUND ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF TAXA, WITH AT LEAST 35 AND 19 DISTINCT SEQUENCES IN ASCOMYCETES AND BASIDIOMYCETES RESPECTIVELY, WERE REVEALED. MANY GROUPS DISPLAYED VARIABLE ABILITY TO DECOMPOSE NEEDLES. FURTHERMORE, MANY ASCOMYCETES, INCLUDING THREE VOLATILE-PRODUCING MUSCODOR SPECIES (XYLARIACEAE), SHOWED THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT PATHOGENS. NOTABLY, MOST LACCASE-PRODUCING SPECIES SHOWED LITTLE OR NO ANTIBIOSIS AND VICE VERSA. CLAVICIPITALEAN AND USTILAGINOMYCETOUS FUNGI, SPECIFICALLY TOXIC TO INSECTS, WERE INFERRED FROM TAXONOMIC INFORMATION. INTRA-SPECIFIC PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATION IN PEZICULA SPORULOSA, A SECOND DOMINANT SPECIES, WAS CLEARLY HIGH. WE CONCLUDE THAT A SUITE OF DEFENSIVE CHARACTERISTICS IN ENDOPHYTES CONTRIBUTES TO IMPROVING HOST FITNESS UNDER VARIOUS STRESSES AND THAT A DIVERSITY OF LACCASE GENES CONFERS AN ECOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE IN COMPETITION FOR NUTRIENTS. INTRA-SPECIFIC DIVERSITY MAY BE OF GREAT ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR ECOTYPIC ADAPTATION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A FAIR DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL COMPLEMENTARITY RATHER THAN REDUNDANCY AMONG ENDEMIC SYMBIONTS OF NATURAL PLANT POPULATIONS.  2010 THE BRITISH MYCOLOGICAL SOCIETY.","INSTITUTE OF SUBTROPICAL FORESTRY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF FORESTRY, FUYANG, CHINA, KEY LABORATORY OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CROP PATHOGENS AND INSECTS, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, INSTITUTE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY, CHINA;INSTITUTE OF SUBTROPICAL FORESTRY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF FORESTRY, FUYANG, CHINA;INSTITUTE OF SUBTROPICAL FORESTRY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF FORESTRY, FUYANG, CHINA;KEY LABORATORY OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CROP PATHOGENS AND INSECTS, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE, INSTITUTE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY, CHINA;FENGYANGSHAN-BAISHANZU NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE, CHINA","10.1016/j.funbio.2010.11.002","ARTICLE","RISF6902","THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY NON-PROFIT SECTOR SPECIAL RESEARCH FUND OF CHINESE ACADEMY OF FORESTRY (GRANT NUMBER: RISF6902 ).
