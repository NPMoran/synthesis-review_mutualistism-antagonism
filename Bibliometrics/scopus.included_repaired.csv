These relationships are varied and diverse, but a number of studies highlight important trends. The effects of defensive symbionts can be context-dependent and influenced by variable selection imposed by the organism against which the symbiont protects. Additionally, genetic variation in both hosts and symbionts can greatly influence the outcome of these interactions. Here, we describe interactions between siricid woodwasps, their fungal symbionts and parasitic nematodes and show how defense by symbionts in this system is also context-dependent. The species or strain of the white rot fungus used as a symbiont by Sirex can influence parasitism of these hosts by Deladenus nematodes. © 2019",,"animal; Basidiomycetes; Chromadorea; growth, development and aging; larva; microbiology; parasitology; pathogenicity; physiology; symbiosis; wasp; Animals; Basidiomycota; Chromadorea; Larva; Symbiosis; Wasps",,,,,"U.S. Forest Service, USFS","We thank Dr Melanie Smee for comments and suggestions on early versions of the manuscript and Dr Sana Gardescu for assistance with figures.

This conflict can be mediated by food that increases mutual benefits. Although current understanding of sexual cooperation involving food is based exclusively on mating systems with male food control, recent studies have suggested universal female food control across taxa. However, there have been no empirical studies testing food's role in facilitating sexual cooperation in this scenario. Here, we examined the interplay of food availability and mating in the pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, the males of which feed on the exudates from the leaf punctures created by female ovipositors. Given the association between female oviposition and food production, we infer that food controlled by females may alter male optima in mating and thus modulate male courtship strategies for mating. Mating stimulated females to produce abundant punctures, which benefited male feeding and survival. When males were deprived of the punctures, they adopted an elaborate dancing behaviour, leading to increased receptivity of females. However, when males adopted an alternative strategy of directly approaching females, they obtained fewer punctures. After preferential mating with dancing males, females significantly prolonged their life span and increased offspring numbers. Sexual cooperation in leafminers can be explained by the nutritional composition of plant exudates, which we found contain abundant sugars and amino acids. The plant exudates are vital food for males, but their nutritional value and availability rapidly declined with time. Our study reveals that the food produced by females can provide mutual benefits to male survival and female reproduction. Our study of food control by females extends our understanding of evolution in sexual cooperation. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","alternative mating strategy; behavioural ecology; Liriomyza; resource control","behavioral ecology; cooperative behavior; courtship; feeding behavior; female behavior; fly; food availability; reproductive strategy; sexual behavior; Agromyzidae; Liriomyza; Liriomyza huidobrensis",,,,,"2017YFD0200400

It is currently unknown how intraspecific variation in PSFs interacts with the environment (e.g., nutrient availability) to influence competition between native and invasive plants. We conducted a fully crossed multi-factor greenhouse experiment to determine the effects of Phragmites australis rhizosphere soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability on biomass of replicate populations from one native and two invasive lineages of common reed (P. australis) and a single lineage of native smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Harmful soil biota consistently dominated PSFs involving all three P. australis lineages, reducing biomass by 10%. Indirect PSFs (i.e., soil biota spillover) from the two invasive P. australis lineages reduced S. alterniflora biomass by 7%, whereas PSFs from the native P. australis lineage increased S. alterniflora biomass by 6%. Interestingly, interspecific competition and PSFs interacted to weaken their respective impacts on S. alterniflora, whereas they exerted synergistic negative effects on P. australis. Phragmites australis soil biota decreased S. alterniflora biomass when grown alone (i.e., a soil legacy), but increased S. alterniflora biomass when grown with P. australis, suggesting that P. australis recruits harmful generalist soil biota or facilitates S. alterniflora via spillover (i.e., apparent mutualism). Soil biota also reduced interspecific competition impacts on S. alterniflora, although it remained competitively inferior to P. australis across all treatments. Competitive interactions and responses to nutrients did not differ among P. australis lineages, indicating that interspecific competition and nutrient deposition may not be key drivers of P. australis invasion in North America. Although soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability appear to have no direct impact on the success of invasive P. australis lineages in North America, intraspecific lineage variation in indirect spillover and soil legacies from P. australis occur and may have important implications for co-occurring native species and restoration of invaded habitats. Our study integrates multiple factors linked to plant invasions, highlighting that indirect interactions are likely commonplace in influencing plant community dynamics and invasion success and impacts. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","indirect interactions; interspecific competition; invasive species; nutrients; Phragmites australis; soil biota; soil legacy; Spartina alterniflora; spillover","biological invasion; herb; intraspecific variation; invasive species; native species; nutrient availability; plant community; rhizosphere; soil biota; soil-vegetation interaction; spillover effect; wetland; North America; Phragmites australis; Spartina alterniflora; North America; plant; Poaceae; soil; wetland; North America; Plants; Poaceae; Soil; Wetlands",,"Soil",,,"Sigma Xi

Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human–animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","competition; cooperation; individual specialization; individual variation; intrapopulation variation; social learning; specialized behaviour; trade-off; Tursiops truncatus","artisanal fishery; competition (ecology); cooperative behavior; dolphin; foraging behavior; individual variation; intrapopulation variation; learning; social behavior; spatial analysis; specialization; trade-off; Brazil; Animalia; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 153797/2016-9, 407190/2012-0

Despite the advantage of carrying these microbes, they are typically only found in a fraction of the individuals within a population and are often non-randomly distributed among host populations. It is currently unclear why facultative symbionts are only found in certain host individuals and populations. Here we provide evidence for a mechanism to help explain this phenomenon: that when symbionts interact with non-native host genotypes it can limit the horizontal transfer of symbionts to particular host lineages and populations of related hosts. Results: Using reciprocal transfections of the facultative symbiont Hamiltonella defensa into different pea aphid clones, we demonstrate that particular symbiont strains can cause high host mortality and inhibit offspring production when injected into aphid clones other than their native host lineage. However, once established, the symbiont's ability to protect against parasitoids was not influenced by its origin. We then demonstrate that H. defensa is also more likely to establish a symbiotic relationship with aphid clones from a plant-adapted population (biotype) that typically carry H. defensa in nature, compared to clones from a biotype that does not normally carry this symbiont. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that certain aphid lineages and populations of related hosts are predisposed to establishing a symbiotic relationship with H. defensa. Our results demonstrate that host-symbiont genotype interactions represent a potential barrier to horizontal transmission that can limit the spread of symbionts, and adaptive traits they carry, to certain host lineages. © 2018 The Author(s).","Bacterial mutualism; Co-evolution; Facultative symbiosis; Horizontal transfer","aphid; bacterium; biotype; clone; coevolution; eukaryote; facultative behavior; fitness; genotype; horizontal transmission; host-symbiont interaction; invasive species; mortality; reproduction; symbiont; symbiosis; Acyrthosiphon pisum; Aphididae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa; Eukaryota; adaptation; animal; aphid; Enterobacteriaceae; feeding behavior; fertility; genetics; genotype; microbiology; parasitology; phenotype; physiology; plant; symbiosis; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Aphids; Enterobacteriaceae; Feeding Behavior; Fertility; Genotype; Phenotype; Plants; Symbiosis",,,,,"865.12.003

Recently, two major themes of research have developed. First, there has been a growing interest in the proximate, mechanistic processes underpinning parasite-associated behaviour change, and the interactive roles of the neuro-, immune, and other physiological systems in determining relationships between behaviour and infection susceptibility. Secondly, as the study of behaviour has shifted away from one-off measurements of single behaviours and towards a behavioural syndromes/personality framework, research is starting to focus on the consequences of parasite infection for temporal and contextual consistency of behaviour, and on the implications of different personality types for infection susceptibility. In addition, there is increasing interest in the potential for relationships between cognition and personality to also have implications for host-parasite interactions. As models well-suited to both the laboratory study of behaviour and experimental parasitology, teleost fish have been used as hosts in many of these studies. In this review we provide a broad overview of the range of mechanisms that potentially generate links between fish behaviour, personality, and parasitism, and illustrate these using examples drawn from the recent literature. In addition, we examine the potential interactions between cognition, personality and parasitism, and identify questions that may be usefully investigated with fish models. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cognition; Disease; Infection; Manipulation; Personality; Syndromes","cognition; disease; fish; host-parasite interaction; infectivity; parasitism; physiological response; animal behavior; behavior change; cognition; fish; host parasite interaction; infection sensitivity; nonhuman; parasitism; parasitosis; personality; Review; teleost; animal; cognition; fish; host parasite interaction; parasitology; personality; physiology; symbiosis; Teleostei; Animals; Cognition; Fishes; Host-Parasite Interactions; Personality; Symbiosis",,,,,,,"Aalvik, I.M., Moland, E., Olsen, E.M., Stenseth, N.C., Spatial ecology of coastal Atlantic cod Gadus morhua associated with parasite load (2015) J.

The major difference between these two species is that male aggression is more frequent and intense in male-dominated chimpanzees than in bonobos, where the highest-ranking individuals are female [1]. One potential explanation is that because periods of female sexual receptivity and attractiveness are more extended in bonobos [2], males compete less intensely for each mating opportunity. This would reduce the strength of selection for traits that lead to success in direct contest competition between males and in sexual coercion of females, thus increasing the potential for female choice [3]. Accordingly, it has been predicted that the influence of male dominance rank on reproductive success and the extent of male reproductive skew should be lower in bonobos than in chimpanzees [1]. Although relevant for understanding the evolution of the unusual levels of egalitarianism and cooperation found in human hunter-gatherers [4], comparative analyses in the genus Pan have been limited by the scanty paternity data available for wild bonobos [5]. Here, we show using the largest sample of paternity data available that, contrary to expectation, male bonobos have a higher reproductive skew and a stronger relationship between dominance rank and reproductive success than chimpanzees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"animal; comparative study; Democratic Republic Congo; male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; physiology; reproduction; sexual behavior; Animals; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Male; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal",,,,,"National Institute on Aging, NIA: R01AG049395",,"Hare, B., Wobber, V., Wrangham, R., The self-domestication hypothesis: Evolution of bonobo psychology is due to selection against aggression (2012) Anim.

Turn-taking in Common Murres (Uria aalge) involves the foraging bird returning to the colony to provision the chick and the brooding parent departing. We examined whether Common Murres in poor condition had slower or more irregular turn-taking behavior, as has been documented in Common Murres equipped with geologgers. Irregularities include the brooding bird not trading parental roles with its returning mate or a bird returning to the colony without a fish. Irregular turn-taking sequences generally took longer than normal turn-taking sequences and differed in the rate and synchrony of allopreening, the main interactive behavior between mates. There was a delayed onset of allopreening when nest reliefs were protracted, whereas returners that did not bring a fish started allopreening sooner than either their brooding partners or other returners that brought a fish. Common Murres in better condition (higher body mass and lower lipid metabolite levels) left the colony sooner after their returning mates fed the chick compared to Common Murres in worse condition. Birds with higher chick-feeding rates brought fish back in more visits, which suggests that these were higher-quality birds. When birds vary in their turn-taking ceremonial behaviors, they may be negotiating by providing their partners with cues about their condition. Since Common Murres have long-term pair bonds and both parents are necessary to raise offspring, mates should respond to information from their partners if they can do so without compromising their own condition beyond a critical threshold. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.","allopreening; bill fencing; negotiation; parental care; quality; turn-taking; Uria aalge","colony; grooming; parental care; seabird; social behavior; Aves; Uria aalge",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: 7475, 312407-2010","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Discovery Grant no. 7475, to A.E.S.; and no. 312407-2010, to C.J.W.) and by the Newfoundland and Labrador Murre Conservation Fund (to A.E.S. and C.J.W.).","Ainley, D.G., Nettleship, D.N., Carter, H.R., Storey, A.E., Common Murre (Uria aalge) (2002) The Birds of North America, 666. , (A.

The costs and benefits of these interactions show a strong context-dependency directly related to individual variation in partner identity and differential strength. Yet understanding the context-dependency and functional consequences of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions on individuals remains a lasting challenge. We use a network approach to characterize the individual, plant-based pollination interaction networks of the Canarian Isoplexis canariensis (Plantaginaceae) with a mixed assemblage of vertebrate mutualists (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and predispersal seed predators). We identify and quantify interaction typologies based on the sign (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) and strength (weak vs. strong) of animal-mediated pollination and test the relationship with individual female reproductive success (FRS). In addition, we document pollinator movement patterns among individual plants to infer events of pollen transfer/receipt that define the plant mating networks and test the relationship with FRS. We identify six interaction typologies along a mutualism-antagonism gradient, with two typologies being over-represented involving both mutualists and antagonists and influencing FRS. Plants showing strong mutualistic interactions, but also (weak or strong) interactions with antagonists are relatively better connected in the mating network (i.e., with higher potential to transfer or receive pollen). Thus, mixed flower visitor assemblages with mutualists and antagonists give plants increased their importance in the mating networks, promote outcrossing and increasing both female and male fitness. Our approach helps characterize plant-animal interaction typologies, the context-specificity of diversified mutualisms, and a better forecasting of their functional consequences. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America","antagonist; bird pollination; Canary Islands; female reproductive success; individual-based pollination networks; interaction strength; Isoplexis canariensis; mating network; mutualist","antagonism; gradient analysis; individual variation; invertebrate; mutualism; outcrossing; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; Canary Islands; Spain; Animalia; Aves; Invertebrata; Isoplexis canariensis; Plantaginaceae; Squamata; Vertebrata; animal; ecosystem; flower; nectar; pollen; pollination; symbiosis; Animals; Ecosystem; Flowers; Plant Nectar; Pollen; Pollination; Symbiosis",,"Plant Nectar",,,"Ministerio de EconomÃ­a y Competitividad, MINECO: SEV-2012-0262

This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra- and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research. © 2017 The Author(s).

Carmel Valley Rd., Carmel Valley, CA, United States","In communities of large-seeded tree species, generalist seed hoarders often link the temporally variable dynamics of various species in ways that can result in indirect ecological interactions. A special case of such interactions is ‘apparent predation’ – when variation in seed production of one tree species changes the outcome of the interaction between seed hoarders and another tree species from seed dispersal mutualism to predation. We investigated how two species of avian hoarders responded to differences in acorn availability among individual valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and across a landscape dominated by blue oaks (Q. douglasii) to determine whether seed dispersal and predation dynamics result in apparent predation between these oak species. California scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica), high-quality seed dispersers with large spatial scales of resource perception, showed strong numerical and functional responses to individually large Q. lobata acorn crops when landscape-level acorn crops were low, but the numerical response was not observed when Q. douglasii produced a good acorn crop the subsequent year. In contrast, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), which are significant acorn predators, exhibited a consistent functional response to individual Q. lobata acorn crops independent of landscape-wide availability. Consequently, Q. lobata experienced increased predation and a near absence of high-quality seed dispersal when Q. douglasii acorns were abundant. Our results suggest that apparent predation among oak species can arise from contrasting responses of generalist seed predators and dispersers to acorn availability on different spatial scales. Thus, the spatial scale of resource perception, which can differ greatly among generalist seed hoarders, may provide a proximate mechanism underlying indirect, temporally variable ecological affects such as apparent predation among sympatric species of large-seeded trees.

Male coalition formation can be an alternative reproductive strategy to one-on-one competition to maximize male reproductive success. Here we focus on age as a state variable to explain within-group variation in individual propensity to form coalitions against other group members. We specifically test the prediction that males conditionally switch from a solo strategy for achievement of high mating success to a cooperative strategy after reaching post-prime age in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We combined new observations with data collected in 2006 and 2008 on the same individuals from one captive group living in semi-natural conditions at Affenberg Salem, Germany, and found that in all years males between 5 and 13 years formed significantly fewer coalitions than males 14 years and older (post-prime). More importantly, we found those males that aged into the post-prime phase to have switched their reproductive strategy and to form significantly more coalitions in 2014 compared to 2008. These first longitudinal data together with earlier cross-sectional analyses in this and other primate species suggest that group-level measures of coalition propensity may be strongly affected by the age composition of groups and that male coalition formation can be a conditional reproductive strategy. © Author(s) 2017.",,,,,,,,,"Alberts, S.C., Magnitude and sources of variation in male reproductive performance (2012) The Evolution of Primate Societies, pp. 412-431. , edited by: Mitani, J.

The presence of just one or a few keystone individuals, such as leaders or tutors, may have a large effect on collective outcomes. These individuals can catalyze behavioral changes in other group members, thus altering group composition and collective behavior. The influence of keystone individuals on group function may lead to trade-offs between ecological situations, because the behavioral composition they facilitate may be suitable in one situation but not another. We use computer simulations to examine various mechanisms that allow keystone individuals to exert their influence on group members. We further discuss a trade-off between two potentially conflicting collective outcomes, cooperative prey attack and disease dynamics. Our simulations match empirical data from a social spider system and produce testable predictions for the causes and consequences of the influence of keystone individuals on group composition and collective outcomes. We find that a group’s behavioral composition can be impacted by the keystone individual through changes to interaction patterns or behavioral persistence over time. Group behavioral composition and the mechanisms that drive the distribution of phenotypes influence collective outcomes and lead to trade-offs between disease dynamics and cooperative prey attack. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

Such coordination, however, often occurs selectively, and the contextual information animals use to determine when they coordinate and when they do not is unclear. We investigate this issue in the highly territorial downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) by exploring how individuals within a social breeding pair differentially modulate coordinated aggressive responses during graded simulated territorial intrusions (STIs). Analyses show that resident pairs mount a more robust aggressive response to STIs that represent a greater threat. Moreover, in this social context, pair members produce contact vocalizations in a way that predicts their partner’s aggressive behavior. We also show that, when presented with a low threat, individuals that first respond to intrusions decrease their aggressive output once their partner attends to the stimulus; the partner, in turn, increases their levels of aggressive behavior. This does not occur in high-threat STIs, where both partners maintain high levels of aggression throughout the entire encounter. Together, these results show that individuals within a pair flexibly adjust their aggressive tactics in response to different social competitive contexts, and this includes adjusting the way in which individuals coordinate certain aspects of their agonistic repertoire. We speculate that this ability reflects an adaptive mechanism that allows individuals to fine-tune territorial tactics to reduce overall costs of aggression. Significance statement: Although research has demonstrated that individuals often coordinate their behavior to accomplish common tasks, little is known about the factors that determine when such coordination occurs and when it does not. We address this issue for the first time in the highly territorial downy woodpecker by testing how the level of threat associated with a territorial interaction influences the coordination of defensive behavior. We find that, when facing intruders that pose a greater threat, residents adjust levels of aggressive output in response to the number of vocalizations produced by their breeding partner. By contrast, this relationship is not observed when pairs face intruders that pose a relatively lower threat. Our data therefore provide striking evidence that coordination in defensive tactics depends on the residents’ appraisal of the social context, such that fiercer competition is associated with greater behavioral coordination. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cooperation; Downy woodpecker; Monogamy; Social behavior; Territorial aggression","aggression; behavioral response; bird; breeding population; competition (ecology); cooperative behavior; mating behavior; monogamy; territoriality; vocalization; Animalia; Picoides pubescens",,,,,,,"Behr, O., Territorial songs indicate male quality in the sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata (Chiroptera, Emballonuridae) (2006) Behav Ecol, 17, pp. 810-817; Bell, M.B., Radford, A.N., Smith, R.A., Thompson, A.M., Ridley, A.R., Bargaining babblers: vocal negotiation of cooperative behaviour in a social bird (2010) Proc R Soc Lond B, 277, pp. 3223-3228. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC3cflsV2gsw%3D%3D; Benedict, L., Rose, A., Warning, N., Canyon wrens alter their songs in response to territorial challenges (2012) Anim Behav, 84, pp. 1463-1467; Briefer, E., Rybak, F., Aubin, T., When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis (2008) Anim Behav, 76, pp. 1319-1325; Budaev, S.V., Using principal components and factor analysis in animal behaviour research: caveats and guidelines (2010) Ethology, 116, pp. 472-480; Conner, R.N., Foraging habitats of woodpeckers in Southwestern Virginia (1980) J Fields Ornithol, 51, pp. 119-127; Desjardins, J.K., Hofmann, H.A., Fernald, R.D., Social context influences aggressive and courtship behavior in a cichlid fish (2012) PLoS ONE, 7. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XhtVOnsb%2FE, PID: 22807996; Dodenhoff, D.J., (2002) An analysis of acoustic communication within the social system of downy woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens), , PhD Thesis: Ohio State University; Dodenhoff, D.J., Stark, R.D., Johnson, E.V., Do woodpecker drums encode information for species recognition?

Losing the ability to perform such functions can be advantageous due to cost savings, but when they are essential for growth, organisms become dependent on ecological partners to compensate for those losses. When multiple functions may be lost, the ecological outcomes are potentially diverse, including independent organisms only; one-way dependency, where one partner performs all functions and others none; or mutual interdependency where partners perform complementary essential functions. What drives these different outcomes? We develop a model where organisms perform 'leaky' functions that provide both private and public benefits to explore the consequences of privatization level, costs and essentiality on influencing these outcomes. We show that mutual interdependency is favoured at intermediate levels of privatization for a broad range of conditions. One-way dependency, in contrast, is only favoured when privatization is low and loss-of-function benefits are accelerating. Our results suggest an interplay between privatization level and shape of benefits from loss in driving microbial dependencies. Given the ubiquity of microbial functions that are inevitably leaked and the ease of mutational inactivation, our findings may help to explain why microbial interdependencies are common in nature. © 2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"biological model;

Recent research, however, indicates that the ability to form cooperative social bonds has an equally strong effect on fitness. Two implications follow. First, strong social bonds make individuals’ fitness inter- dependent and the ‘free-rider’ problem disappears. Second, individuals must make adaptive choices that balance competition and cooperation—often with the same partners. The proximate mechanisms underlying these behaviours are only just beginning to be understood. Recent results from cognitive and systems neuroscience provide us some evidence that many social and non- social decisions are mediated ultimately by abstract, domain-general neural mechanisms. However, other populations of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala and parietal cortex specifically encode the type, importance and value of social information. Whether these specialized popu- lations of neurons arise by selection or through developmental plasticity in response to the challenges of social life remains unknown. Many brain areas are homologous and show similar patterns of activity in human and non- human primates. In both groups, cortical activity is modulated by hormones like oxytocin and by the action of certain genes that may affect individual differences in behaviour. Taken together, results suggest that differences in cooperation between the two groups are a matter of degree rather than constituting a fundamental, qualitative distinction. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We develop a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individual’s ability to use information when acquiring resources. As resource distribution underpins both selection on information use and the strength and nature of competition between individuals, we demonstrate interdependencies between the two that should be common in nature. Individuals in our model can search for resources either personally or by using social information. We explore selection on social information use across a comprehensive range of ecological conditions, generalizing the producer–scrounger framework to a wide diversity of taxa and resources. We show that resource ecology—defined by scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizability—determines patterns of individual differences in social information use. These differences suggest coevolutionary processes linking dominance systems and social information use, with implications for the evolutionary demography of populations. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Mathematical models typically find that such conflict can be resolved by partial-response strategies, leading investors to contribute relatively equitably. Using a case study approach, we show that such model expectations can be contradicted in at least four disparate contexts: (i) bi-parental care; (ii) cooperative breeding; (iii) cooperative hunting; and (iv) human cooperation. We highlight that: (a) marked variation in contributions is commonplace; and (b) individuals can often respond positively rather than negatively to the contributions of others. Existing models have surprisingly limited power in explaining these phenomena. Here, we propose that, although among-individual variation in cooperative contributions will be influenced by differential costs and benefits, there is likely to be a strong genetic or epigenetic component. We then suggest that selection can maintain high investors (key individuals) when their contributions promote support by increasing the benefits and/or reducing the costs for others. Our intentions are to raise awareness in—and provide testable hypotheses of—two of the most poorly understood, yet integral, questions regarding cooperative ventures: why do individuas vary in their contributions and when does cooperation beget cooperation?. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We used a radial basis function surface approximation subject to minimum description length constraint to uncover the state-space dynamical systems from time series data. This approximation allowed us to infer structure from a mathematical model of the movement behaviour of sheep and red deer, and the effect of density, thermal stress and vegetation type. Animal movement was recorded using GPS collars deployed in sheep and deer grazing a large experimental plot in winter and summer. Information on the thermal stress to which animals were exposed was estimated using the power consumption of mechanical heated models and meteorological records of a network of stations in the plot. Thermal stress was higher in deer than in sheep, with less differences between species in summer. Deer travelled more distance than sheep, and both species travelled more in summer than in winter; deer travel distance showed less seasonal differences than sheep. Animal movement was better predicted in deer than in sheep and in winter than in summer; both species showed a swarming behaviour in group cohesion, stronger in deer. At shorter separation distances swarming repulsion was stronger between species than within species. At longer separation distances inter-specific attraction was weaker than intra-specific; there was a positive density-dependent effect on swarming, and stronger in deer than in sheep. There was not clear evidence which species attracted or repelled the other; attraction between deer at long separation distances was stronger when the model accounted for thermal stress, but in general the dynamic movement behaviour was hardly affected by the thermal stress. Vegetation type affected intra-species interactions but had little effect on inter-species interactions. Our modelling approach is useful in interpreting animal interactions, in order to unravel complex cooperative or competitive behaviours, and to the best of our knowledge is the first modelling attempt to make predictions of multi-species animal movement under different habitat mosaics and abiotic environmental conditions. © 2015 Pérez-Barbería et al.

Interactions between species can vary from mutually beneficial to evolutionarily neutral to antagonistic, even when the same two species are involved. Similarly, social interactions between members of the same species can lie on a spectrum from conflict to cooperation. 2. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variation in the two types of social behaviour are interconnected. Is the fitness of the various classes of social partner within species (such as parent and offspring, or male and female) differently affected by interactions with a second species? Moreover, can inter-specific interactions influence the outcome of social interactions within species? 3. The present experiments focus on the interactions between the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides Herbst and the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi G. Canestrini & R. Canestrini. The approach was to measure the fitness of burying beetle mothers, fathers, and offspring after reproduction, which took place either in the presence or absence of mites. 4. We found that male, female, and larval burying beetles derive contrasting fitness costs and benefits from their interactions with the mite, despite sharing a common family environment. From the mite's perspective, its relationship with the burying beetle can, therefore, be simultaneously antagonistic, neutral, and possibly even mutualistic, depending on the particular family member involved. We also found that mites can potentially change the outcome of evolutionary conflicts within the family. 5. We conclude that inter-specific interactions can explain some of the variation in social interactions seen within species. It is further suggested that intra-specific interactions might contribute to variation in the outcome of interactions between species. © 2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","Animal families; Nicrophorus; Social evolution; Trophic interactions","antagonism; beetle; evolutionary theory; fitness; interspecific interaction; mutualism; reproductive cost; Acari; Animalia; Coleoptera; Nicrophorus; Nicrophorus vespilloides",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 310785",,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Bates, D., Maechler, M., Bolker, B., (2011), http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4, lme4: Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using S4 Classes.

Here we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punishing roles in animal societies. We apply our scheme to societies of eusocial Hymenoptera and nonhuman vertebrate social breeders, and we outline potential extensions for understanding conflict regulation among cells in metazoan bodies and unrelated individuals in human societies. We highlight that: 1) no social unit is expected to express punishment behavior unless it collects positive inclusive fitness benefits that surpass alternative benefits of bystanding; 2) punishment with public good benefits can be maintained through either direct fitness benefits (coercion) or indirect fitness benefits (correction) or both; 3) differences across social systems in the distributions of power, relatedness, and reproductive options drive variation in the extent to which individuals actively punish; and 4) inclusive fitness logic captures many punishment-relevant evolutionary and ecological variables in a single framework that appears to apply across very different types of social arrangements. Synthesis Researchers have long observed that individuals in animal societies punish (and by extension, police) each other, but they have rarely investigated whether general principles underlie this behavior across social arrangements. In this paper, we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punisher roles in animal societies. We apply the approach to eusocial insects and cooperatively breeding vertebrates and outline extensions towards the control of cancer cell lineages and punishment in human groups. We highlight how variation in specific social variables may drive differences in punishing/policing across the social domains. © 2015 The Authors.",,"decadal variation; eusociality; fitness; human evolution; reproductive cost; social insect; vertebrate; Animalia; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera; Metazoa; Vertebrata",,,,,,,"Balshine-Earn, S., Paying to stay or paying to breed?

For example, the evolutionary forces that determine natural frequencies of bacteria that express cooperative behaviours at low levels remain poorly understood. Natural isolates of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus sampled from the same fruiting body often vary in social phenotypes, such as group swarming and multicellular development. Here, we tested whether genotypes highly proficient at swarming or development might promote the persistence of less socially proficient genotypes from the same fruiting body. Fast-swarming strains complemented slower isolates, allowing the latter to keep pace with faster strains in mixed groups. During development, one low-sporulating strain was antagonized by high sporulators, whereas others with severe developmental defects had those defects partially complemented by high-sporulating strains. Despite declining in frequency overall during competition experiments spanning multiple cycles of development, developmentally defective strains exhibited advantages during the growth phases of competitions. These results suggest that microbes with low-sociality phenotypes often benefit from interacting with more socially proficient strains. Such complementation may combine with advantages at other traits to increase equilibrium frequencies of low-sociality genotypes in natural populations. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Such a view is however increasingly at odds with the growing empirical literature, showing nontrivial levels of signal variation within prey populations. Key to understanding this variation, we argue, could be a recognition that toxicity levels frequently vary within populations because of environmental heterogeneity. Inequalities in defense may undermine mutualistic monomorphic signaling, causing evolutionary antagonism between loci that determine appearance of less well-defended and better defended prey forms within species. In this article, we apply a stochastic model of evolved phenotypic plasticity to the evolution of prey signals. We show that when toxicity levels vary, then antagonistic interactions can lead to evolutionary conflict between alleles at different signaling loci, causing signal evolution, ""red queen-like"" evolutionary chase, and one or more forms of signaling equilibria. A key prediction is that variation in the way that predators use information about toxicity levels in their attack behaviors profoundly affects the evolutionary characteristics of the prey signaling systems. Environmental variation is known to cause variation in many qualities that organisms signal; our approach may therefore have application to other signaling systems. © 2014 The Author(s).","Aposematism; Chemical defense; Coevolution; Mosaic of coevolution; Predator; Prey; Red queen","adaptation; allele; antagonism; aposematism; chemical defense; heterogeneity; numerical model; phenotypic plasticity; predator-prey interaction; queen; signaling; stochasticity; animal; biological model; color; computer simulation; evolution; phenotype; predation; statistical model; statistics; Animals; Biological Evolution; Color; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Phenotype; Predatory Behavior; Stochastic Processes",,,,,,,"Berenbaum, M.R., Zangerl, A.R., Chemical phenotype matching between a plant and its insect herbivore (1998) Proc.

Existing theoretical work on the conflict over care has: (a) rarely considered the influence of tactical investment during offspring production on later contributions to offspring rearing; (b) concentrated mainly on biparental care, rather than cooperatively caring groups comprising both parents and helpers; and (c) typically ignored relatedness between carers as a potential influence on investment behavior. We use a game-theoretical approach to explore the effects of female production tactics and differing group relatedness structures on the expected rearing investment contributed by breeding females, breeding males, and helpers in cooperative groups. Our results suggest that the breeding female should pay higher costs overall when helpful helpers are present, as she produces additional offspring to take advantage of the available care. We find that helpers related to offspring through the breeding female rather than the breeding male should contribute less to care, and decrease their contribution as group size increases, because the female refrains from producing additional offspring to exploit them. Finally, within-group variation in helper relatedness also affects individual helper investment rules by inflating the differences between the contributions to care of dissimilar helpers. Our findings underline the importance of considering maternal investment decisions during offspring production to understand investment across the entire breeding attempt, and provide empirically testable predictions concerning the interplay between maternal, paternal and helper investment and how these are modified by different relatedness structures. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biparental care; Cooperative breeding; Game theory; Load lightening; Maternal effects; Provisioning rules","breeding; cooperative breeding; female; game theory; group size; male; parental care; parental investment; rearing; relatedness; reproduction",,,,,"Natural Environment Research Council

The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable eco-evolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive dynamics; Biological market; Coevolution; Non-heritable phenotypic variance; Plant-animal mutualism; Population dynamics","biodiversity; coevolution; evolutionary biology; heritability; mutation; mutualism; numerical model; phenotypic plasticity; population dynamics; Animalia; adaptive dynamics; animal; article; Biological market; coevolution; evolution; genetics; Non-heritable phenotypic variance; phenotype; plant; Plant-animal mutualism; population dynamics; theoretical model; Adaptive dynamics; Biological market; Coevolution; Non-heritable phenotypic variance; Plant-animal mutualism; Population dynamics; Animals; Biological Evolution; Models, Theoretical; Phenotype; Plants",,,,,"Stanford University, SU","We thank Tadashi Fukami, Deborah Gordon, Noah Rosenberg, Samuel M.

Theoretical studies on the evolution of helping and harming behaviors have largely focused upon genetic differences between individuals. However, nongenetic variation between group members is widespread in natural populations, and may mediate differences in individuals' social behavior. Here, we develop a framework to study how variation in individual quality mediates the evolution of unconditional and conditional social traits. We investigate the scope for the evolution of social traits that are conditional on the quality of the actor and/or recipients. We find that asymmetries in individual quality can lead to the evolution of plastic traits with different individuals expressing helping and harming traits within the same group. In this context, population viscosity can mediate the evolution of social traits, and local competition can promote both helping and harming behaviors. Furthermore, asymmetries in individual quality can lead to the evolution of competition-like traits between clonal individuals. Overall, we highlight the importance of asymmetries in individual quality, including differences in reproductive value and the ability to engage in successful social interactions, in mediating the evolution of helping and harming behaviors © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Individual variation; Kin selection; Nongenetic differences; Quality discrimination; Reproductive value; Social value","clone; evolutionary biology; gene expression; genetic variation; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive behavior; social behavior; theoretical study; amoeba (life cycle stage); animal; article; biological model; cooperation; evolution; genetics; individual variation; kin selection; nongenetic differences; physiology; quality discrimination; reproductive value; social behavior; social value; wasp; Individual variation; kin selection; nongenetic differences; quality discrimination; reproductive value; social value; Amoeba; Animals; Biological Evolution; Helping Behavior; Models, Biological; Social Behavior; Wasps",,,,,,,"Alexander, R.D., The evolution of social behaviour (1974) Annu.

The evolution of increased resistance can be constrained by constitutive costs associated with possessing defense mechanisms, and by induced costs of deploying them. These two types of costs are typically considered with respect to resistance as a genetically determined trait, but they may also apply to resistance provided by 'helpers' such as bacterial endosymbionts. We investigated the costs of symbiont-conferred resistance in the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae (Scopoli), which receives strong protection against the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum from the defensive endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa. Aphids infected with H. defensa were almost ten times more resistant to L. fabarum than genetically identical aphids without this symbiont, but in the absence of parasitoids, they had strongly reduced lifespans, resulting in lower lifetime reproduction. This is evidence for a substantial constitutive cost of harboring H. defensa. We did not observe any induced cost of symbiont-conferred resistance. On the contrary, symbiont-protected aphids that resisted a parasitoid attack enjoyed increased longevity and lifetime reproduction compared with unattacked controls, whereas unprotected aphids suffered a reduction of longevity and reproduction after resisting an attack. This surprising result suggests that by focusing exclusively on the protection, we might underestimate the selective advantage of infection with H. defensa in the presence of parasitoids. © 2013 The Authors.

Diverse bacterial lineages infect eukaryotes and some of these infections offer significant benefits in terms of survival and reproduction. How did these bacterial mutualists evolve initially? Moreover what forces keep beneficial bacteria from exploiting their hosts or from abandoning their hosts when better options exist? Finally, under what conditions do these symbiotic interactions break down?

Aggressive propensity is usually an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates) according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social contexts, especially in highly social species. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Behavioural syndrome; Body condition; Cichlid; Growth; Neolamprologus pulcher; Personality; Resource allocation; Social context","aggression; behavioral ecology; body condition; cichlid; conspecific; cooperative breeding; dominance; environmental effect; fat reserve; intraspecific competition; life history trait; resource allocation; shelter; social behavior; trade-off; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher",,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur FÃ¶rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNSF: 31003A_122511","We acknowledge support of the Swiss National Science Foundation ( 31003A_122511 to M.T.).

However, field experimental evidence documenting these shifts has never been reported for a cleaning symbiosis. Here, we demonstrate shifts in a freshwater cleaning symbiosis in a system involving crayfish and branchiobdellid annelids. Branchiobdellids have been shown to benefit their hosts under some conditions by cleaning material from host crayfish's gill filaments. The system is uniquely suited as an experimental model for symbiosis due to ease of manipulation and ubiquity of the organisms. In three field experiments, we manipulated densities of worms on host crayfish and measured host growth in field enclosures. In all cases, the experiments revealed shifts from mutualism to parasitism: host crayfish growth was highest at intermediate densities of branchiobdellid symbionts, while high symbiont densities led to growth that was lower or not significantly different from 0-worm controls. Growth responses were consistent even though the three experiments involved different crayfish and worm species and were performed at different locations. Results also closely conformed to a previous laboratory experiment using the same system. The mechanism for these shifts appears to be that branchiobdellids switched from cleaning host gills at intermediate densities of worms to consuming host gill tissue at high densities. These outcomes clearly demonstrate shifts along a symbiosis continuum with the maximum benefits to the host at intermediate symbiont densities. At high symbiont densities, benefits to the host disappear, and there is some evidence for a weak parasitism. These are the first field experimental results to demonstrate such shifts in a cleaning symbiosis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Cleaning behavior; Context dependence; Mutualism; Parasitism; Symbiosis","annelid; cleaning behavior; complexity; crayfish; ecological theory; enclosure experiment; experimental study; field survey; freshwater ecosystem; growth response; host-parasite interaction; mutualism; parasitism; animal; annelid; article; crayfish; feeding behavior; gill; growth, development and aging; host parasite interaction; parasitology; population density; symbiosis; Animals; Annelida; Astacoidea; Feeding Behavior; Gills; Host-Parasite Interactions; Population Density; Symbiosis; Annelida; Astacoidea; Branchiobdellida",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DEB-0949823, DEB-0949780

We found that that queen social behaviours are extraordinarily diverse, resulting in three distinct colony social systems distributed in different geographical regions. Experiments show that these differences arise from variation in queen behaviours at two distinct times in the colony life cycle, and are likely to result from underlying genetic differences between regions. Results from our population genetics analyses and the biogeography of the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts suggest that the different queen social behaviours may have evolved in previously isolated populations, with their current distributions explained in part by subsequent range expansions rather than local adaptation in situ. However, regions with alternative social forms currently meet in contact zones where gene flow and natural selection on alternative social systems should occur. The degree of geographical variation in social behaviours exhibited by M. pergandei results in an opportunity to study the role that gene flow, local adaptation, genetic drift and past history can play in the evolution of behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Ant; Conflict; Cooperation; Cooperative breeding; Geographical variation; Messor pergandei; Social behaviour","ant; antagonism; behavioral ecology; cooperative breeding; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; geographical variation; intraspecific variation; isolated population; life cycle; local adaptation; natural selection; queen; range expansion; zoogeography; United States; Messor pergandei",,,,,,,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behaviour: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Arnold, S.J., Behavioural variation in natural populations.

Because social behaviour is often a plastic response to the social environment, consistent variation in social behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group. In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social environment and may be an important selective influence on social behaviour and on variation among social groups. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Aggression; Behavioural syndrome; Cichlid; Cooperative breeding; Dominance; Indirect phenotypic effect; Neolamprologus pulcher; Personality","aggression; behavioral ecology; defense behavior; group behavior; interspecific interaction; perciform; phenotypic plasticity; social behavior; taxonomy; Cichlidae; Neolamprologus pulcher",,,,,,,"Awata, S., Takeuchi, H., Kohda, M., The effect of body size on mating system and parental roles in a biparental cichlid fish (Julidochromis transcriptus): a preliminary laboratory experiment (2006) Journal of Ethology, 24, pp. 125-132; Bergmüller, R., Taborsky, M., Adaptive behavioural syndromes due to strategic niche specialization (2007) BMC Ecology, 7, p. 12; Bergmüller, R., Heg, D., Peer, K., Taborsky, M., Extended safe havens and between-group dispersal of helpers in a cooperatively breeding cichlid (2005) Behaviour, 142, pp. 1643-1667; Bergmüller, R., Schürch, R., Hamilton, I.M., Evolutionary causes and consequences of consistent individual variation in cooperative behaviour (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 365, p. 2751; Bijma, P., Wade, M.J., The joint effects of kin, multilevel selection and indirect genetic effects on response to genetic selection (2008) Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 21, pp. 1175-1188; Bruintjes, R., Taborsky, M., Helpers in a cooperative breeder pay a high price to stay: effects of demand, helper size and sex (2008) Animal Behaviour, 75, pp. 1843-1850; Bshary, R., Biting cleaner fish use altruism to deceive image-scoring client reef fish (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 269, pp. 2087-2093; Bshary, R., Grutter, A.S., Image scoring and cooperation in a cleaner fish mutualism (2006) Nature, 441, pp. 975-978; Buchner, A.S., Sloman, K.A., Balshine, S., The physiological effects of social status in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher (2004) Journal of Fish Biology, 65, pp. 1080-1095; Cheverud, J.M., Evolution in a genetically heritable social environment (2003) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 100, p. 4357; Coeckelberghs, V., Territorial, spawning and parental behaviour of Lamprologus brichardi Poll 1974 (Pisces: Cichlidae) (1975) Annales de la Société Royale Zoologique de Belgique, 105, pp. 73-86; Cote, J., Clobert, J., Social personalities influence natal dispersal in a lizard (2007) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 274, p. 383; Cote, J., Dreiss, A., Clobert, J., Social personality trait and fitness (2008) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 275, p. 2851; Cote, J., Clobert, J., Brodin, T., Fogarty, S., Sih, A., Personality-dependent dispersal: characterization, ontogeny and consequences for spatially structured populations (2010) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 365, pp. 4065-4076; Cote, J., Fogarty, S., Weinersmith, K., Brodin, T., Sih, A., Personality traits and dispersal tendency in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) (2010) Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 277, p. 1571; Dieckmann, U., Can adaptive dynamics invade?

Intriguingly, 30 to 40 per cent of all nests are deserted by both parents. To understand the evolution of this diverse breeding system and frequent clutch desertion, we use 6 years of field data to derive fitness expectations for males and females depending on whether or not they care for their offspring. The resulting payoff matrix corresponds to an asymmetric Snowdrift Game with two alternative evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs): female-only and male-only care. This, however, does not explain the polymorphism in care strategies and frequent biparental desertion, because theory predicts that one of the two ESSs should have spread to fixation. Using a bootstrapping approach, we demonstrate that taking account of individual variation in payoffs explains the patterns of care better than a model based on the average population payoff matrix. In particular, a model incorporating differences in male attractiveness closely predicts the observed frequencies of male and female desertion. Our work highlights the need for a new generation of individual-based evolutionary game-theoretic models. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Cooperation; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Evolutionary game theory; Nest desertion; Sexual conflict; Snowdrift Game","bootstrapping; brood desertion; cooperative breeding; evolutionarily stable strategy; fitness; game theory; individual variation; individual-based model; mate attraction; parental care; passerine; polygamy; reproductive strategy; sexual conflict; Remiz pendulinus",,,,,,,"Clutton-Brock, T.H., Russell, A.F., Sharpe, L.L., Young, A.J., Balmforth, Z., McIlrath, G.M., Evolution and development of sex differences in cooperative behaviour in meerkats (2002) Science, 297, pp. 253-256. , (doi:10.1126/science.1071412); Sharp, S.P., Simeoni, M., Hatchwell, B.J., Dispersal of sibling coalitions promotes helping among immigrants in a cooperatively breeding bird (2008) Proc.

Examples of negative feedback are density dependence (population regulation) and frequency-dependent selection (polymorphisms). Positive feedback, in turn, plays a role in Fisherian 'runaway' sexual selection, the evolution of cooperation, selfing and inbreeding tolerance under purging of deleterious alleles, and the evolution of sex differences in parental care. All these examples feature self-reinforcing processes where the increase in the value of a trait selects for further increases, sometimes via a coevolutionary feedback loop with another trait. Positive feedback often leads to alternative stable states (evolutionary endpoints), making the interpretation of evolutionary predictions challenging. Here, we discuss conceptual issues such as the relationship between self-reinforcing selection and disruptive selection. We also present an extension of a previous model on parental care, focusing on the relationship between the operational sex ratio and sexual selection, and the influence of this relationship on the evolution of biparental or uniparental care. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Alternative stable states; Feedback; Frequency dependence","autogamy; coevolution; cooperative breeding; density dependence; evolutionary biology; feedback mechanism; inbreeding; life history trait; parental care; polymorphism; population regulation; sex role; sexual selection",,,,,,,"de Jong, H., Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory systems: A literature review (2002) J.

We offer an alternative perspective, in which parasites and their hosts are used as a model system, suggesting that Prisoner's dilemma may be rare due to different individuals experiencing variation in the payoffs they receive from alternative strategies. Ectoparasites (such as fleas) move stochastically between hosts, causing differential parasite burdens. The resulting variance in the need for cooperation - in this case cooperative allogrooming - means that payoffs for different strategies (e.g. cooperate and defect) are not fixed. Our simulations revealed that due to parasite dynamics, cooperation among hosts conforms to a mixture of two games: Mutualism and Cruel Bind, both of which are more likely to coerce individuals into mutual cooperation than Prisoner's dilemma. Though interesting, Prisoner's dilemma is in fact the least likely scenario. If payoff variation is common, the dominance of the Prisoner's dilemma paradigm may have made us unnecessarily puzzled by cooperation in nature.","Cooperation; Cruel Bind; Ectoparasites; Fleas; Mutualism; Prisoner's dilemma","ectoparasite; flea; game theory; host-parasite interaction; mutualism; stochasticity; Siphonaptera (fleas)",,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., (1984) The evolution of co-operation., , Basic Books, Inc., New York; Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Barrett, L., Henzi, S.P., Weingrill, T., Lycett, J.E., Hill, R.A., Market forces predict grooming reciprocity in female baboons (1999) Proc.

This view has been challenged by the finding that individuals might cooperatively partition resources by ""taking turns"". Turn-taking occurs when two individuals coordinate their agonistic behaviour in a way that leads to an alternating pattern in who obtains a resource without engaging in costly fights. Cooperative turn-taking has been largely ignored in models of animal conflict and socio-ecological models that explain the evolution of social behaviours based only on contest and scramble competition. Currently it is unclear whether turn-taking should be included in socio-ecological models because the evolution of turn-taking is not well understood. In particular, it is unknown whether turn-taking can evolve when fighting costs and assessment of fighting abilities are not fixed but emerge from evolved within-fight behaviour. We address this problem with an evolutionary agent-based model. Results: We found that turn-taking evolves for small resource values, alongside a contest strategy that leads to stable dominance relationships. Turn-taking leads to egalitarian societies with unclear dominance relationships and non-linear dominance hierarchies. Evolutionary stability of turn-taking emerged despite strength differences among individuals and the possibility to evolve within-fight behaviour that allows good assessment of fighting abilities. Evolutionary stability emerged from frequency-dependent effects on fitness, which are modulated by feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies. Conclusions: Our results reveal the impact of feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies, such as turn-taking. Similar feedbacks might be important for the evolution of other conflict strategies such as winner-loser effects or coalitions. However, we are not aware of any study that investigated such feedbacks. Furthermore, our model suggests that turn-taking could be used by animals to partition low value resources, but to our knowledge this has never been tested. The existence of turn-taking might have been overlooked because it leads to societies with similar characteristics that have been expected to emerge from scramble competition. Analyses of temporal interaction patterns could be used to test whether turn-taking occurs in animals. © 2011Franz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"agonistic behavior; dominance; evolutionary theory;

As such, mutualism opposes mechanisms of kin selection and tag-based selection (for example the green beard mechanism), which are based on giving exclusive help to partners that are related or carry the same tag. In contrast to kin selection, which is a basis for parochialism and intergroup warfare, mutualism can therefore be regarded as a mechanism that drives peaceful coexistence between different groups and individuals. Here the competition between mutualism and kin (tag) selection is studied. In a model where kin selection and tag-based selection are dominant, mutualism is promoted by introducing environmental fluctuations. These fluctuations cause reduction in reproductive success by the mechanism of variance discount. The best strategy to counter variance discount is to share with agents who experience the most anticorrelated fluctuations, a strategy called bet hedging. In this way, bet hedging stimulates cooperation with the most unrelated partners, which is a basis for mutualism. Analytic results and simulations reveal that, if this effect is large enough, mutualistic strategies can dominate kin selective strategies. In addition, mutants of these mutualistic strategies that experience fluctuations that are more anticorrelated to their partner, can outcompete wild type, which can lead to the evolution of specialization. In this way, the evolutionary success of mutualistic strategies can be explained by bet hedging-based cooperation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Diversity; Group; Inclusive fitness; Reciprocal altruism; Relatedness","coexistence; competition (ecology); cooperative behavior; ecological modeling; evolutionary biology; group behavior; inclusive fitness; kin selection; mutualism; relatedness; article; bet hedging based cooperation; competition; cooperation; environmental factor; evolution; human; kin selection; mate choice; mutant; priority journal; reproductive fitness; reproductive success; simulation; symbiosis; wild type; Animals; Evolution, Molecular; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Selection, Genetic",,,,,,,"Antal, T., Ohtsuki, H., Wakely, J., Taylor, P.D., Nowak, M.A., Evolution of cooperation by phenotypic similarity (2009) Proc.

The distinction is made primarily according to kinship as predicted by the kin selection theory. With regards to humans, however, this is not always the case; in particular, humans sometimes exhibit a discriminate sociality on the basis of culturally transmitted traits, such as personal ornaments, languages, rituals, etc. This paper explores the possibility that the human faculty of cultural transmission and resultant cultural variation among individuals may have facilitated the evolution of discriminate sociality in humans. To this end, a gene-culture coevolutionary model is developed focusing on competition over control of resource as a context in which discriminate sociality may have evolved. Specifically, two types of culture-dependent discriminate sociality are considered: ingroup favouritism, with ingroup and outgroup being distinguished by the presence or absence of a cultural trait; and prestige hierarchies, with the prestige being conferred on the bearer of a cultural trait. The model specifies the conditions under which emergence and evolutionary stability of the two types of discriminate sociality are promoted by the presence of cultural variation among individuals. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Cultural niche construction; Hawk-Dove game; Ingroup favouritism; Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition; Prestige; Tag-based cooperation","coevolution; cooperative behavior; cultural change; cultural influence; cultural tradition; evolutionary theory; genetics; individual variation; language; niche; Paleolithic; public attitude; social behavior; Animalia; article; cultural anthropology; evolution; human; social behavior; theoretical model; Biological Evolution; Cultural Evolution; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Social Behavior",,,,,,,"Hamilton, W.D., The genetical evolution of social behavior (1964) J.

However, focusing on ungulates, I here review increasing evidence that a comprehensive understanding of sexually selected adaptations requires consideration of a broader range of sex roles, particularly those relating to female behaviour. I show how mate competition and mate choice in both sexes can interact and often lead to intra- and intersexual conflicts and sometimes also cooperation. By causing phenotypic selection, these behavioural interactions can shape evolution although the outcome depends on genetic constraints. I conclude that to advance the understanding of mammalian mating systems we must broaden our conceptual framework from being largely focused on male competitive strategies to encompass coevolutionary dynamics between the mating strategies of both sexes. Future challenges include clarifying (1) the ecological basis for the inter- and intraspecific diversity in sex roles, (2) the condition-dependence of female mating strategies, and (3) the ultimate causes of mate competition and promiscuity in females. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Deception; Mate choice; Sex roles; Sexual conflict; Sexual selection; Sperm competition","Mammalia; Ungulata",,,,,,,"Ahnesjö, I., Kvarnemo, C., Merilaita, S., Using potential reproductive rates to predict mating competition among individuals qualified to mate (2001) Behavioral Ecology, 12, pp. 397-401; Alonzo, S.H., Pizzari, T., Male fecundity stimulation: Conflict and cooperation within and between the sexes: Model analyses and coevolutionary dynamics (2010) American Naturalist, 175, pp. 174-185; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Balmford, A., Albon, S., Blakeman, S., Correlates of male mating success and female choice in a lek-breeding antelope (1992) Behavioral Ecology, 3, pp. 112-123; Balmford, A., Bartoš, L., Brotherton, P., Herrmann, H., Lancingerova, J., Mika, J., Zeeb, U., When to stop lekking-density-related variation in the rutting behaviour of sika deer (1993) Journal of Zoology, 231, pp. 652-656; Barry, K.L., Kokko, H., Male mate choice: Why sequential choice can make its evolution difficult (2010) Animal Behaviour, 80, pp. 163-169; Bateman, A.J., Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila (1948) Heredity, 2, pp. 349-368; Beatty, R.A., Bennett, G.H., Hall, J.G., Hancock, J.L., Stewart, D.L., An experiment with heterospermic insemination in cattle (1969) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 19, pp. 491-502; Bebie, N., McElligott, A.G., Female aggression in red deer: Does it indicate competition for mates?

In this study, an integrative culture system was designed to capture a rich fungal consortium from the conifer Abies beshanzuensis. Results indicate an impressive diversity of fungal lineages (a total of 84 taxa classified in Dikarya) and a relatively high proportion of hitherto unknown species (27.4. %). The laccase gene was used as a functional marker due to its involvement in lignocellulose degradation. Remarkable diversity of laccase genes was found across a wide range of taxa, with at least 35 and 19 distinct sequences in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes respectively, were revealed. Many groups displayed variable ability to decompose needles. Furthermore, many ascomycetes, including three volatile-producing Muscodor species (Xylariaceae), showed the ability to inhibit pathogens. Notably, most laccase-producing species showed little or no antibiosis and vice versa. Clavicipitalean and ustilaginomycetous fungi, specifically toxic to insects, were inferred from taxonomic information. Intra-specific physiological variation in Pezicula sporulosa, a second dominant species, was clearly high. We conclude that a suite of defensive characteristics in endophytes contributes to improving host fitness under various stresses and that a diversity of laccase genes confers an ecological advantage in competition for nutrients. Intra-specific diversity may be of great ecological significance for ecotypic adaptation. These findings suggest a fair degree of functional complementarity rather than redundancy among endemic symbionts of natural plant populations. © 2010 The British Mycological Society.","Antagonism; Decomposer; Functional diversity; Helotiales; Intra-specific variation; Laccase genes; White rot fungi","fungal DNA; laccase; adaptive radiation; antagonism; biodiversity; biomarker; coniferous tree; dominance; ecotype; endophyte; enzyme activity; fitness; fungal disease; genetic analysis; host-symbiont interaction; inhibition; insect; intraspecific variation; pathogenicity; population structure; species diversity; taxonomy; toxic substance; volatile substance; Abies; antibiosis; article; Ascomycetes; Basidiomycetes; biodiversity; classification; culture medium; DNA sequence; enzymology; fungus; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiological examination; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; species difference; symbiosis; Abies; Antibiosis; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Biodiversity; Culture Media; DNA, Fungal; Fungi; Laccase; Microbiological Techniques; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Symbiosis; Abies; Abies beshanzuensis; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Helotiales; Hexapoda; Hypocreales; Muscodor; Pezicula sporulosa; Xylariaceae","GENBANK: GU975809, GU975810, GU975811, GU975812, GU975813, GU975814, GU975815, GU975816, GU975817, GU975818, GU975819, GU975820, GU975821, GU975822, GU975823, GU975824, GU975825, GU975826, GU975827, HM484174, HM484175, HM484176, HM484177, HM484178, HM484179, HM484180, HM484181, HM484182, HM484183, HM484184, HM484185, HM484186, HM484187, HM484188, HM484189, HM484190, HM484191, HM484192, HM484193, HM484194, HM484195, HM484196, HM484197, HM484198, HM484199, HM484200, HM484201, HM484202, HM484203, HM484204, HM484205, HM484206, HM484207, HM484208","laccase, 80498-15-3; Culture Media; DNA, Fungal; Laccase, 1.10.3.2",,,"RISF6902","The research has been financially supported by Non-profit Sector Special Research Fund of Chinese Academy of Forestry (grant number: RISF6902 ).

Such care may involve major costs to the individual. Balancing benefits and costs of care almost inevitably leads to tensions among individuals that provide and use the resource 'parental care'. Thus parental care and with it parental investment (i.e. the ultimate costs of care) is enacted in a game of conflict and cooperation. Using mostly examples from mammals, I discuss Tinbergen's four questions as they apply to parental care. Phylogenetic analyses of parental care are complicated by substantial intraspecific variability of this trait. Understanding the physiological and ontogenetic processes underlying parental care behaviour helps to understand how differences in the cost of care depend on the state of parents and their environment. A deeper insight into the strategies of conflict and cooperation in care can be derived from consideration of the behavioural mechanisms available to participants.© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In particular, when analysing the evolution of cooperation it is often implicitly assumed that ignoring variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate, differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change the nature of a game. Even small amounts ofvariability can stabilize cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters. Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction, leading to contingent behaviour that can reduce conflict, and to negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations, whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets, so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner, variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor the previous behaviour of others, and once this social sensitivity exists, the need to maintain a good reputation can promote cooperation. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Assessment; Negotiation; Reputation; Social sensitivity","cheating behavior; cooperative behavior; environmental effect; evolutionarily stable strategy; evolutionary theory; game theory; learning; life history trait; mutation; natural selection",,,,,,,"Axen, A.H., Leimar, O., Hoffman, V., Signalling in a mutualistic interaction (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52 (2), pp. 321-333. , DOI 10.1006/anbe.1996.0178; Bergmúller, R., Schurch, R., Hamilton, I.M., Evolutionary causes and consequences of consistent individual variation in cooperative behaviour (2010) Phil.

The evolutionary interests of males and females rarely coincide (sexual conflict), and these conflicting interests influence morphology, behavior and speciation in various organisms. We examined consequences of variation in sexual conflict in two closely-related passerine birds with contrasting breeding systems: the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (EPT) exhibiting a highly polygamous breeding system with sexually antagonistic interests over parental care, and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit Anthoscopus minutus (CPT). We derived four a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory and tested these using data collected in Central Europe (EPT) and South Africa (CPT). Firstly, we predicted that EPTs exhibit more sexually dimorphic plumage than CPTs due to more intense sexual selection. Secondly, we expected brighter EPT males to provide less care than duller males. Thirdly, since song is a sexually selected trait in many birds, male EPTs were expected to exhibit more complex songs than CPT males. Finally, intense sexual conflict in EPT was expected to lead to low nest attendance as an indication of sexually antagonistic interests, whereas we expected more cooperation between parents in CPT consistent with their socially monogamous breeding system. Results. Consistent with our predictions EPTs exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in plumage and more complex song than CPTs, and brighter EPT males provided less care than duller ones. EPT parents attended the nest less frequently and less simultaneously than CPT parents. Conclusions. These results are consistent with sexual conflict theory: species in which sexual conflict is more manifested (EPT) exhibited a stronger sexual dimorphism and more elaborated sexually selected traits than species with less intense sexual conflict (CPT). Our results are also consistent with the notion that EPTs attempt to force their partner to work harder as expected under sexual conflict: each member of the breeding pair attempts to shift the costs of care to the other parent. More brightly colored males benefit more from desertion than dull ones, because they are more likely to remate with a new female. Taken together, the comparison between two closely related species with contrasting breeding systems suggest that sexual conflict over care has influenced the evolution of behavior and morphology in penduline tits. © 2010 van Dijk et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"antagonism; behavioral ecology; morphology; passerine; polygamy; sexual conflict; sexual dimorphism; speciation (biology); Central Europe; South Africa; animal; article; conflict; female; male; physiology; sexual behavior; sexual development; songbird; Animals; Conflict (Psychology); Female; Male; Passeriformes; Sex Characteristics; Sexual Behavior, Animal",,,,,,,"Parker, G.A., Sexual selection and sexual conflict (1979) Sexual Selection and Reproductive Competition in Insects, pp. 123-166. , New York: Academic Press Blum MS, Blum NA; Lessells, C.M., The evolutionary outcome of sexual conflict (2006) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 361 (1466), pp. 301-317. , DOI 10.1098/rstb.2005.1795; Van Dijk, R.E., Székely, T., Post-fertilization reproductive strategies (2008) Encyclopedia of Life Sciences (ELS), , Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd; Arnqvist, G., Rowe, L., (2005) Sexual Conflict, , Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press; Houston, A.I., Székely, T., McNamara, J.M., Conflict between parents over care (2005) Trends Ecol Evol, 20, pp. 33-38. , 10.1016/j.tree.2004.10.008. 16701338; Gavrilets, S., Arnqvist, G., Friberg, U., The evolution of female mate choice by sexual conflict (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 268 (1466), pp. 531-539. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.2000.1382; Hosken, D., Snook, R., How important is sexual conflict?

The huge diversity of symbiotic associations among animals and/or plants comprises both mutualisms and parasitisms. Most symbioses between social insect species, however, involve social parasites, while mutual benefits have been only suspected for some parabiotic associations - two colonies that share a nest. 2. In the rainforest of Borneo, we studied parabiotic associations between the ants Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur. Parabiotic nests were regularly found inside hollow tree trunks, most likely initiated by Cr. modiglianii. This species frequently nested without its partner, whereas we never found non-parabiotic Ca. rufifemur nests. We experimentally investigated potential benefits, potential interference competition for food (as a probable cost), and foraging niches of both species. 3. The two species never showed aggressive interactions and amicably shared food resources. However, Cr. modiglianii had a wider temporal and spatial foraging range than Ca. rufifemur, always found baits before Ca. rufifemur and recruited more efficiently. Camponotus rufifemur probably benefited from following pheromone trails of Cr. modiglianii. In turn, Ca. rufifemur was significantly more successful in defending the nest against alien ants. Crematogaster modiglianii hence may profit from its partner's defensive abilities. 4. In neotropical parabioses, epiphytes grown in 'ant-gardens' play a crucial role in the association, e.g. by stabilization of nests. Hemiepiphytic Poikilospermum cordifolium (Cecropiaceae) seedlings and saplings frequently grew in the entrances of parabiotic nests in Borneo, obviously dispersed by the ants. In cafeteria experiments, both parabiotic ants carried its elaiosome-bearing seeds into the nest. However, P. cordifolium does not provide additional nest space, contrasting with neotropical ant-gardens. 5. The parabiotic association appears beneficial for both ant species, the main benefits being nest initiation by Cr. modiglianii and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur), and, in turn, nest defence by Ca. rufifemur (for Cr. modiglianii). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa. © 2009 British Ecological Society.","Formicidae; Interspecific associations; Mutualism; Parasitism; Symbiosis","ant; epiphyte; interference competition; nesting behavior; rainforest; social insect; symbiosis; animal; animal behavior; ant; article; physiology; species difference; symbiosis; Animals; Ants; Behavior, Animal; Species Specificity; Symbiosis; Borneo; Animalia; Camponotus rufifemur; Crematogaster modiglianii; Formicidae; Hexapoda; Poikilospermum; Urticaceae",,,,,,,"Adams, E.S., Interaction between the ants Zacryptocerus maculatus and Azteca trigona: Interspecific parasitization of information (1990) Biotropica, 22, pp. 200-206; Blüthgen, N., Fiedler, K., Competition for composition: Lessons from nectar-feeding ant communities (2004) Ecology, 85, pp. 1479-1485; Blüthgen, N., Mezger, D., Linsenmair, K.E., Ant-hemipteran trophobioses in a Bornean rainforest - Diversity, specificity and monopolisation (2006) Insectes Sociaux, 53, pp. 194-203; Bronstein, J.L., Conditional outcomes in mutualistic interactions (1994) Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 9, pp. 214-217; Bronstein, J.L., Barbosa, P., Multitrophic/multispecies mutualistic interactions: The role of non-mutualists in shaping and mediating mutualisms (2002) Multitrophic Level Interactions, pp. 44-66. , eds.

Here, we present an overview of why and how the social network approach might be useful for behavioral ecology. We first note four important aspects of SNS that are commonly observed, but relatively rarely quantified: (1) that within a social group, differences among individuals in their social experiences and connections affect individual and group outcomes; (2) that indirect connections can be important (e.g., partners of your partners matter); (3) that individuals differ in their importance in the social network (some can be considered keystone individuals); and (4) that social network traits often carry over across contexts (e.g., SN position in male-male competition can influence later male mating success). We then discuss how these four points, and the social network approach in general, can yield new insights and questions for a broad range of issues in behavioral ecology including: mate choice, alternative mating tactics, male-male competition, cooperation, reciprocal altruism, eavesdropping, kin selection, dominance hierarchies, social learning, information flow, social foraging, and cooperative antipredator behavior. Finally, we suggest future directions including: (1) integrating behavioral syndromes and SNT; (2) comparing space use and SNS; (3) adaptive partner choice and SNS; (4) the dynamics and stability (or instability) of social networks, and (5) group selection shaping SNS.","Cooperation; Dominance hierarchies; Mate choice; Social behavior; Social network theory","animal; behavioral ecology; cooperative behavior; dominance; group selection; intrasexual interaction; kin selection; mate choice; reproductive strategy; reproductive success; social behavior; social network; space use; theoretical study; Animalia",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IOS 0078033, 0222063","Acknowledgements This paper emerged from a workshop on social network theory funded largely by the Animal Behavior Graduate Group at the University of California at Davis.

Such encounters typically lead to a natural histocompatibility response in which colonies either fuse to become a single, chimeric colony or reject and aggressively compete for space. These allorecognition phenomena mediate intraspecific competition [1-3], support allotypic diversity [4], control the level at which selection acts [5-8], and resemble allogeneic interactions in pregnancy and transplantation [9-12]. Despite the ubiquity of allorecognition in colonial phyla, however, its molecular basis has not been identified beyond what is currently known about histocompatibility in vertebrates and protochordates. We positionally cloned an allorecognition gene by using inbred strains of the cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which is a model system for the study of invertebrate allorecognition. The gene identified encodes a putative transmembrane receptor expressed in all tissues capable of allorecognition that is highly polymorphic and predicts allorecognition responses in laboratory and field-derived strains. This study reveals that a previously undescribed hypervariable molecule bearing three extracellular domains with greatest sequence similarity to the immunoglobulin superfamily is an allodeterminant in a lower metazoan. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In species with alternative male reproductive tactics, the highest androgen levels have usually been reported in dominant males. However, in sociable species, dominant males show amicable behaviors to gain access to females, which might conflict with high testosterone levels. We compared testosterone, corticosterone, and resting metabolic rate in male striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) following a conditional strategy with three different reproductive tactics: (i) philopatric group-living males, (ii) solitary-living roamers, (iii) dominant but sociable group-living territorial breeders. Philopatrics had the lowest testosterone but highest corticosterone levels, suggesting that they make the best of a bad job. Dominant territorial breeders had lower testosterone levels than roamers, which have a lower competitive status. Roamers had the highest testosterone levels, which might promote risky behavior, such as invading territories defended by territorial males. Roamers also had lower resting metabolic rates than either type of group-living males. Our results suggest that dominant males' testosterone levels reflect a trade-off between low testosterone amicable behavior and high testosterone dominance behavior. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

Here, I investigate the interaction between pups and helpers in the communally breeding banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), where each pup forms an exclusive relationship with a single adult helper (termed its 'escort'). By experimentally manipulating pup need, I demonstrate that changes in begging rate correspond to changes in short-term need. The data then suggest that escorts in good condition may be more responsive to increased begging and that pups associating with them increase their begging more than do pups paired with escorts in poor condition. Escorts also appear more responsive to increased begging by female pups, and female pups increase their begging more than do male pups. These results suggest that banded mongoose pups may strategically adjust their investment in begging in relation to variation in the expected pay-off. I argue that such adjustment is likely to be a general phenomenon: wherever there is variation in responsiveness to signals, signallers will be selected to identify different categories of receiver and adjust their signals in order to maximize the pay-offs. Therefore, differences in signal intensity may be as much a product of context as an indication of variation in individual phenotypic or genotypic state. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Banded mongoose; Begging; Cooperative care; Honest signalling; Mungos mungo; Parent-offspring-conflict","begging behavior; carnivore; cooperative behavior; display behavior; experimental study; honest signaling; mammal; parent-offspring interaction; parental care; phenotypic plasticity; trade-off; animal experiment; article; breeding; Carnivora; controlled study; cub; female; genotype; male; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; Mungos mungo",,,,,,,"Acebo, C., Thoman, E.B., Role of infant crying in the early mother-infant dialogue (1995) Physiol.

One resolution to this paradox may be through fitness benefits arising from interactions of genetically diverse individuals. Advantageous phenotypes that are impossible in single individuals (e.g. being simultaneously bold and shy) can be expressed by groups composed of genetically different individuals. Genetic diversity, therefore, can produce mutualistic benefits shared by all group members. We define this effect as 'social heterosis', and mathematically demonstrate maintenance of allelic diversity when diverse groups or neighbourhoods are more reproductively successful than homogenous ones. Through social heterosis, genetic diversity persists without: frequency dependence within groups, migration, balancing selection, genetic linkages, overdominance, antagonistic pleiotropy or nonrandom allele assortment. Social heterosis may also offer an alternative evolutionary pathway to cooperation that does not require clustering of related individuals, nepotistic favouritism towards kin, or overt reciprocity. © 2007 The Authors.","Frequency dependence; Genetic diversity; Group selection; Heterosis; Kin selection","allele; fitness; genetic drift; group selection; heterosis; kin selection; phenotype; pleiotropy; animal; article; biological model; computer simulation; genetic variability; heterosis; human; Animals; Computer Simulation; Humans; Hybrid Vigor; Models, Genetic; Variation (Genetics)",,,,,,,"Amos, W., Harwood, J., Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations (1998) Philos.

We tracked changes in morph frequency and fitness of Lacerta vivipara and found conspicuous RPS cycles. Morphs of Uta and Lacerta exhibited parallel survival-performance trade-offs. Frequency cycles in both species of lizards are driven by genic selection. In Lacerta, frequency of each allele in adult cohorts had significant impacts on juvenile recruitment, similar to mutualistic, altruistic, and antagonistic relations of RPS alleles in Uta. We constructed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models in which adults impact juvenile recruitment as a function of self versus nonself color recognition. ESS models suggest that the rapid 4-year RPS cycles exhibited by Lacerta are not possible unless three factors are present: behaviors evolve that discriminate self versus nonself morphs at higher rates than random, self- versus non-self-recognition contributes to density regulation, and context-dependent mate choice evolves in females, which choose sire genotypes to enhance progeny survival. We suggest genic selection coupled to density regulation is widespread and thus fundamental to theories of social system evolution as well as theories of population regulation in diverse animal taxa. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

In primitively eusocial wasps, helpers have a significant chance of inheriting breeding positions. Recent models suggest that because helpers with greater expected future fitness have more to lose, they should invest less in rearing the dominant's offspring. Observations and experiments on the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata support this prediction: helpers nearer to the front of the queue to inherit dominance, and helpers that stand to inherit larger, more productive groups, work less hard. These findings support the view that variation in social traits is best understood from a life-history perspective. Group augmentation effects, where greater helping effort leads to direct benefits through increased group size, seem less important in wasps. Further studies are required to understand how conflicts over helping effort are resolved in social wasps. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.",,"altruism; colonial breeding; dominance; fitness; individual variation; life history trait; parental investment; relatedness; social insect; wasp; Liostenogaster flavolineata; Polistes dominulus; Polistinae",,,,,,,"Canestrani, D., Marcos, J.M., Baglione, V., Effect of parentage and relatedness on the individual contribution to cooperative chicks care in carrion crows Corvus corone corone (2005) Behav.

Shorebirds represent an ideal model system for this endeavor, because they exhibit diverse breeding systems that include monogamy, with the parents cooperating to rear the young; and polygamy by the male, the female, or both parents, with one parent taking full responsibility for incubating the eggs and rearing the young. Recent experimental manipulations, mathematical models, and phylogenetic analyses reveal that evolutionary pressures may diverge as they act on mated pairs of shorebirds, favoring one parent at a cost to the other.

Models predict that mutualists might often evolve into parasites, can abandon their partners to live autonomously and are also vulnerable to extinction. Yet a basic empirical question, whether mutualisms commonly break down, has been mostly overlooked. As we discuss here, recent progress in molecular systematics helps address this question. Newly constructed phylogenies reveal that parasites as well as autonomous (non-mutualist) taxa are nested within ancestrally mutualistic clades. Although models have focused on the propensity of mutualism to become parasitic, such shifts appear relatively rarely. By contrast, diverse systems exhibit reversions to autonomy, and this might be a common and unexplored endpoint to mutualism. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

How is cooperation maintained in the face of selection for selfishness and cheating? Both theory and data suggest that partner choice, where one species preferentially directs aid to the more cooperative members of the other species, is central to cooperation in many mutualisms. However, the theory has only so far considered the evolutionary effects of partner choice on one of the species in a mutualism in isolation. Here, we investigate the co-evolution of cooperation and choice in a choosy host and its symbiont. Our model reveals that even though choice and cooperation may be initially selected, it will often be unstable. This is because choice reduces variation in the symbiont and, therefore, tends to remove the selective incentive for its own maintenance (a scenario paralleled in the lek paradox in female choice and policing in within-species cooperation). However, we also show that when variability is reintroduced into symbionts each generation, in the form of less cooperative individuals, choice is maintained. This suggests that the presence of cheaters and cheater species in many mutualisms is central to the maintenance of partner choice and, paradoxically, cooperation itself. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Cheating; Cooperation; Lek paradox; Mutualism; Partner-choice; Sanctions","cheating behavior; coevolution; cooperative behavior; evolutionary theory; host preference; mutualism; article; controlled study; cooperation; host; nonhuman; priority journal; species dominance; symbiont; symbiosis",,,,,,,"Bao, T., Addicott, J.F., Cheating in mutualism: Defection of Yucca baccata against its yucca moths (1998) Ecol.

In this review I describe known and less well-known proximate aspects of cooperation and conflict over reproductive behaviour in social animals, where individuals other than the genetic parents contribute to the provisioning of care ('alloparental care'). Traditionally the evolution of alloparental care is viewed as a two-step process: the decision to delay dispersal and independent breeding, usually as a consequence of the existence of constraints on independent breeding, and the decision to behave as alloparents by which individuals that have delayed dispersal gain a net fitness benefit. Behavioural ecological theory generally assumes that all individuals are similar in 'make-up' and that life history and behavioural decisions are facultative. However, there is probably more individual variation in the amount and type of social behaviour than originally anticipated. Here, I demonstrate that some of these differences in behaviours are because of environmental factors, which may be associated with 'reaction norms' or the genotype's quantitative phenotypic variation, or which may yield polyethisms. Most evolutionary models of animal cooperation are based on optimality approaches that do not consider individual genetic variation and maternal effects on the variation in the expression of social behaviour. Further research on the genetic basis of cooperations and subordinate-breeder interactions may be crucial for understanding the evolution of social behaviour. If we take individual differences into account our conclusions and explanations of social behaviour may change. Given the conceptual similarities between the various research disciplines addressing different types of cooperation and conflict over investment, the issues described here should lead to more mutual attraction between the different disciplines and stimulate further development in our understanding of cooperation strategies in general. © 2006 The Author.",,"alloparental care; animal; cooperative behavior; environmental factor; genetic variation; reproductive behavior; social behavior; Animalia",,,,,,,"Ancel, A., Visser, H., Handrich, Y., Masman, D., Le Maho, Y., Energy saving in huddling penguins (1997) Nature, 385, pp. 304-305; Arnold, K.E., Owens, I.P.F., Cooperative breeding in birds: A comparative test of the life history hypothesis (1998) Proc.

Here we ask whether the ant-plant Cordia nodosa is able to apply retaliatory sanctions against its ant symbiont Allomerus octoarticulatus, which patrols new shoots to prevent herbivory. We test the hypothesis that the modular design of C. nodosa physiologically ties the growth of housing (stem swellings known as domatia) to the successful development of the attached leaves. We experimentally simulated herbivory by cutting leaves from patrolled shoots and found that the domatia on such 'cheated' shoots suffered higher mortality and lower growth than did controls, evidence for a host sanction. On the other hand, patrolling is costly to the ant, and experiment shows that non-patrollers run a low risk of being sanctioned because most leaves (and the attached domatia) escape heavy herbivory even when patrollers are absent. This suggests that cheaters might enjoy a higher fitness than do mutualists, despite sanctions, but we find that patrolling provides a net fecundity benefit when the colony and plant exceed a minimum size, which requires sustained ant investment in patrolling. These results map directly onto the principal-agent (P-A) game from economics, which we suggest can be used as a framework for studying stability in mutualisms, where high sampling costs and cheating do not allow market effects to select for mutual benefits. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Biological markets; Cooperation; Host sanctions; Market effects; Mutualism; Myrmecophyte","ant; cheating behavior; experimental study; fitness; herbivory; hypothesis testing; mutualism; myrmecophyte; parental investment; plant-insect interaction; selection; Allomerus octoarticulatus; animal experiment; ant; article; biomass; controlled study; Cordia; Cordia nodosa; herbivory; host selection; leaf age; leaf development; nonhuman; plant stem; priority journal; protection; shoot; symbiont; symbiosis; animal; female; growth, development and aging; male; plant leaf; symbiosis; Allomerus octoarticulatus; Cordia nodosa; Animals; Ants; Cordia; Female; Male; Plant Leaves; Symbiosis",,,,,,,"Avila-Sakar, G., Leist, L.L., Stephenson, A.G., Effects of the spatial pattern of leaf damage on growth and reproduction: Nodes and branches (2003) J.

These mutualistic algae are mostly acquired infectiously from the seawater and, according to models of virulence evolution, should be selected to parasitize their hosts.We altered algal transmission between jellyfish hosts in the laboratory to examine the potential for virulence evolution in this widespread symbiosis. In one experimental treatment, vertical transmission of algae (parent to offspring) selected for symbiont cooperation, because symbiont fitness was tied to host reproduction. In the other treatment, horizontal transmission (infectious spread) decoupled symbiont fitness from the host, potentially allowing parasitic symbionts to spread. Fitness estimates revealed a striking shift to parasitism in the horizontal treatment. The horizontally transmitted algae proliferated faster within hosts and had higher dispersal rates from hosts compared to the vertical treatment, while reducing host reproduction and growth. However, a trade-off was detected between harm caused to hosts and symbiont fitness. Virulence trade-offs have been modelled for pathogens and may be critical in stabilising 'infectious' symbioses. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of this symbiosis and illustrate the potential ease with which beneficial symbionts can evolve into parasites. © 2005 The Royal Society.","Evolution of cooperation; Experimental evolution; Mutualism; Symbiosis; Virulence evolution; Zooxanthellae","alga; coevolution; dietary shift; ecological modeling; experimental study; fitness; host-symbiont interaction; jellyfish; mutualism; parasitism; seawater; symbiont; trade-off; vertical transmission; virulence; alga; article; coelenterate; cooperation; coral; dinoflagellate; evolution; jellyfish; nonhuman; parasitism; priority journal; reproduction; Symbiodinium microadriaticum; symbiont; symbiosis; virulence; alga; animal; host parasite interaction; parasitology; physiology; Scyphozoa; algae; Anthozoa; Hydridae; Scyphozoa; Symbiodinium microadriaticum; Algae; Animals; Host-Parasite Relations; Scyphozoa; Symbiosis",,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Baghdasarian, G., Muscatine, L., Preferential expulsion of dividing algal cells as a mechanism for regulating algal-cnidarian symbiosis (2000) Biol.

In this game, each player can either 'cooperate' (invest in a common good) or 'defect' (exploit the other's investment). If the opponent cooperates, you get R if you cooperate and T if you defect. If the opponent defects, you get S if you cooperate and P if you defect. Here T > R > 0 and P > S, so that 'defect' is the best response to any action by the opponent. Thus in a single play of the game, each player should defect. In our game, a fixed maximum number of rounds of the Prisoner's Dilemma game is played against the same opponent. A standard argument based on working backwards from the last round shows that defection on all rounds is the only stable outcome. In contrast, we show that if extrinsic factors maintain variation in behaviour, high levels of co-operation are stable. Our results highlight the importance of extrinsic variability in determining the outcome of evolutionary games.",,"Anthropometry; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Evolutionary algorithms; Psychophysiology; Evolutionary games; Natural selection; Behavioral research; prisoner dilemma; animal behavior; article; biodiversity; calculation; cooperation; evolution; genetic variability; natural selection; nonhuman; outcomes research; phenotypic variation; play; priority journal; prisoner; task performance; technique; theoretical model; Cooperative Behavior; Evolution; Game Theory; Humans; Models, Biological; Mutation; Selection (Genetics); Stochastic Processes; Animalia",,,,,"University of Maryland, UMD

Thus, it is likely that the interactions among plants, mutualists, and other selective agents, such as antagonists, ultimately shape the evolution of floral and flowering traits. We examined the importance of pollination vs pre-dispersal seed predation to selection on plant and floral characters via female plant-reproductive success in Castilleja linariaefolia (Scrophulariaceae). C. linariaefolia is pollinated by hummingbirds and experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by plume moth and fly larvae in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, where this work was conducted. We first examined whether female reproduction in C. linariaefolia was limited by pollination. Supplemental pollination only marginally increased components of female reproduction, likely because seed predation masked, in part, the beneficial effects of pollen addition. In unmanipulated populations, we measured calyx length, flower production, and plant height and used path analysis combined with structural equation modeling to quantify their importance to relative seed set through pathways involving pollination vs seed predation. We found that the strength of selection on calyx length, flower production, and plant height was greater for seed predation pathways than for pollination pathways, and one character, calyx length, experienced opposing selection via pollination vs seed predation. These results suggest that the remarkable intraspecific variation in plant and floral characters exhibited by some flowering plants is likely the result of selection driven, at least in part, by pollinators in concert with antagonists, such as pre-dispersal seed predators. This work highlights the subtle but complex interactions that shape floral and vegetative design in natural ecosystems.",,"pollination; reproductive success; seed predation; Colorado; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States; Animalia; Castilleja; Lepidoptera; Magnoliophyta; Pterophoridae; Scrophulariaceae; Trochilidae",,,,,,,"Addicott, J.F., Variation in the costs and benefits of mutualism: The interaction between yuccas and yucca moths (1986) Oecologia, 70, pp. 486-494; Addicott, J.F., Tyre, A.J., Cheating in an obligate mutualism: How often do yucca moths benefit yuccas?

During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual. We use the volvocalean green algal group as a model-system to understand evolutionary transitions in individuality and to apply and test the theoretical principles presented above. Lastly, we discuss how the different notions of individuality stem from the basic properties of fitness in a multilevel selection context.",,"algae; Volvocales",,,,,,,"Bell, G., The origin and early evolution of germ cells as illustrated by the Volvocales (1985) The Origin and Evolution of Sex, pp. 221-256. , H.

The evolution of social discrimination causes the congealing of phenotypically similar individuais into different, spatially distinct tribes. However, tribal formation is only obtained for certain types of social behavior: altruistic and selfish acts can produce tribes, whereas spiteful and mutualistic behaviors never do. Moreover, reduced hybrid fitness at tribal borders leads to the selection of mating preferences, which then spread to the core areas of the respective tribes. Unlike models of resource competition, our model generates reproductive isolation in an ecologically homogeneous environment. We elaborate on how altruistic acts can lead to reproductive isolation, but also predict that certain types of competition can lead to the speciation effect. Our theory provides a framework for how individual-level interactions mold lineage diversification, with parapatric speciation as a possible end product.","Altruism; Competition; Diversification; Reproductive isolation; Selfishness; Social behavior; Speciation","altruism; evolution; reproductive isolation; social behavior; speciation (biology)",,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., The evolution of cooperation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Baker, M.C., Spitler-Nabors, K.J., Bradley, D.C., Early experience determines song dialect responsiveness of female sparrows (1981) Science, 214, pp. 819-821; Barbujani, G., Sokal, R.R., Zones of sharp genetic change in Europe are also linguistic boundaries (1990) Proc.

It has been proposed that in animals, similar forces influence the payoff distribution between trading partners in sexual selection, intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism. Here we present the first experimental evidence supporting biological market theory in a study on cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus. Cleaners interact with two classes of clients: choosy client species with access to several cleaners usually do not queue for service and do not return if ignored, while resident client species with access to only one cleaning station do queue or return. We used plexiglas plates with equal amounts of food to simulate these behaviours of the two client classes. Cleaners soon inspected 'choosy' plates before 'resident' plates. This supports previous field observations that suggest that client species with access to several cleaners exert choice to receive better (immediate) service.","Biological markets; Labroides dimidiatus; Mutualism; Partner choice","cleaner fish; cooperative behavior; interspecific interaction; intraspecific interaction; mate choice; mutualism; trade-off; Animalia; Labroides; Labroides dimidiatus",,,,,,,"Axelrod, R., Hamilton, W.D., On the evolution of co-operation (1981) Science, 211, pp. 1390-1396; Barrett, L., Henzi, S.P., Weingrill, T., Lycett, J.E., Hill, R.A., Market forces predict grooming reciprocity in female baboons (1999) Proc.

Individuals of some 'client' species have large home ranges, which cover several cleaning stations, while others have small territories or home ranges with access to only one cleaning station. The former can thus choose between cleaners, while the latter cannot. We investigated whether clients with large home ranges change cleaning partners to outplay cleaners against each other to achieve (1) priority of access over clients with no choice at cleaning stations and (2) control over cheating by cleaners. We followed individuals of longnosed parrotfish, Hipposcarus harid, for up to 120 min in their natural environment and noted their interactions with cleaner wrasses, Labroides dimidiatus. Individuals were likely to return to the same cleaning station if the previous interaction had ended without conflict but changed cleaners for the next inspection if they had been either cheated or ignored, at least if the time between two consecutive visits was short. The overall attractiveness of a cleaning station seemed to be largely independent of service quality, which appeared to be similar at all stations. This is the first empirical evidence that the option to change partners is used as a control mechanism to stabilize cooperative behaviour. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,"cheating behavior; cleaner fish; fish; interspecific interaction; mutualism; reef; Hipposcarus harid; Hipposcarus harid; Labridae; Labroides; Labroides dimidiatus; Labroides dimidiatus; Sparisoma cretense",,,,,"European Commission, EC

Although we assume social organisms possess adaptations that allow them to form groups and deal with within-group conflicts, these are often subtle and difficult to detect. Using a simple form of sociality displayed by young ant foundresses of the desert seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei, as a model system, I exploited intraspecific geographic variation in social behaviour to investigate how the social context has altered individual behavioural strategies. I created social groups composed of two normally nonsocial foundresses, normally social foundresses and mixed groups, and compared foundresses' aggression and willingness to invest resources towards colony productivity. Nonsocial foundresses, presumably not adapted to social life, invested significantly more resources into colony growth than normally social foundresses, and experienced reduced survivorship in mixed groups. In contrast, social foundresses displayed two novel competitive behavioural strategies when confronted with nonsocial partners: retaliatory aggression and egg consumption. These results document that the evolution of social behaviour, rather than promoting cooperation, is driven by the evolution of competitive strategies designed to exploit group members and reduce the risk of being exploited by others. © 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,"agonistic behavior; colony founding; cooperative behavior; social insect; spatial variation; Formicidae; Formicidae; Hymenoptera; Messor pergandei; Messor pergandei",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DEB-9623487","I would like to thank Steven Rissing for valuable discussions and advice on experimental design and interpretation.

Ecology Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2525, United States","Many organisms vary their level of investment in defensive characters. Protective traits may be induced upon exposure to predators or parasites. In a similar way, humans vaccinate in response to threatening epidemics. When most group members defend themselves, epidemics die out quickly because parasites cannot spread. A high level of group (herd) immunity is therefore beneficial to the group. There is, however, a well-known divergence between the optimum degree of induction for selfish individuals and the level of induction that maximizes group benefit. I develop two optimality models for the frequency of induction. The first model shows that higher relatedness favours more induction and a smaller difference between selfish and cooperative optima. The second model assumes variation in the vigour of individuals and therefore differences in the relative cost for induction. The model predicts that strong individuals induce more easily than weak individuals. Small differences in vigour cause a large divergence in the optimal levels of induction for strong and weak individuals. The concept of genetic relatedness in an evolutionary model is analogous to correlated interests and correlated strategies in an economic model of human behaviour. The evolutionary models presented here therefore provide a basis for further study of human vaccination.","Disease resistance; Herbivory; Host - parasite; Predator - prey; Vaccination","article; genetics; immunity; model; nonhuman; parasite; predator; priority journal; social evolution",,,,,,,,"Frank, S.A.; Dept.

However, reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples. Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited. I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour. Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non-altruists may become ostracized. I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity. Altruism mall be rewarded in kind, but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all, for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates. This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity. I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality, as proposed by the handicap principle. I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers. I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished.","Altruism; Cooperation; Handicap principle; Prisoner's Dilemma; Reciprocity","altruism; mate choice; reciprocity; altruism; animal behavior; cooperation; evolution; nonhuman; priority journal; short survey",,,,,,,,"Roberts, G.; Evolution Behaviour Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, United Kingdom; email: gilbert.roberts@ncl.ac.uk",,,"Royal Society",,,,,09628452,,PRLBA,,"English","Proc.

The issues considered are applicable to all major transitions in the units of evolution that share two themes: the emergence of cooperation and the regulation of conflict among the lower-level units, in this case, cells. Explicit genetic models of mutation and selection both within and between organisms are studied in sexual and asexual haploid and diploid organisms without a germ line. The results may be understood in terms of the differing opportunities for within-and between-organism selection under the different reproductive modes and parameter values. Cooperation among cells increases when the fitness covariance at the level of the organism overcomes within-organism change toward defecting cells. Selection and mutation during development generate significant levels of within-organism variation and lead to significant variation in organism fitness at equilibrium. The levels of cooperativity attained can be low, even with reproduction passing through a single-cell zygote stage and the high kinship that entails. Sex serves to maintain higher levels of cooperation and lower levels of within-organism change.

Biology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-2525, United States","The transition from competing individuals to cooperative groups has occurred several times in evolutionary history. The puzzle is why selfish individuals did not subvert cohesive group behaviour by taking resources without contributing to the group's overall success. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism are the two standard explanations for group cohesion. But many groups have evolved into cooperative units when relatedness was low and opportunities were limited for the strategic alliances required for reciprocity. A new theory was recently proposed in which individuals invest some of their resources into repressing competition between group members. Such policing increases the fair distribution of resources in the group and enhances group cohesion. The surprising aspect of this theory is that low relatedness is more conducive to the spread of policing traits than is high relatedness. Here a new explanation is developed of the biological processes that favour policing. The model is then extended in two ways. First, more realism is added to the theory by accounting for the full range of costs and benefits associated with competitive and cooperative traits within groups. Second, another surprising results is introduced about cooperative evolution. Small variations in individual vigour or resources can lead to large variations in individual contributions to policing the group. Stronger individuals often invest all of their excess resources into policing, but weaker individuals do not contribute to group cohesion.",,"competition repression; group cohesion; policing behaviour",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: GM42403

In long‐tailed macaques, these friendly reunions have been shown to restore aspects of the social relationship of the opponents to their preconflict state, and they have thus been interpreted as reconciliations. Although postconflict reconciliation would seem to be adaptive to gregarious animals that establish individualized social relationships, its occurrence is variable among species, groups and dyads. Some of this variation probably reflects costs and benefits of reconciling in different situations. One factor that might influence the benefit of reconciliation and hence its occurrence is the value of the social partner as a social or ecological resource: reconciliation should occur more often after fights with valuable social partners. We conducted an experiment to test this hypothesis using pairs of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) as their own controls. First, baseline rates of reconciliation after experimenter‐induced conflict were measured. Then, the value of the relationship, at least in the test context, was increased by training each pair of monkeys to perform a simple cooperative task in which each got access to food only if the partner fed nearby simultaneously. Finally, the reconciliation rate was measured again after training and compared to its baseline value. In 6 of 7 dyads, the reconciliation rate increased after training, and the median reconciliation rate after training was 3 times higher than at baseline. While the results are consistent with the value hypothesis, there are other potential explanations. Comparison of friendly behavior when there had been no prior aggression in baseline and post‐training phases, however, suggested that the increase in reconciliation rate was neither the result of a general increase in compatibility nor the result of anticipated conflict in the cofeeding context. 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,,,,,,,,"Aureli, F., Van Schaik, C.P., Van Hoof, J.A.‐R.‐A.M., Functional aspects of reconciliation among captive long‐tailed macaques (1989) American Journal of Primatology, 19, pp. 39-51; Aureli, F., Van Schaik, C.P., Van Hoof, J.A.‐R.‐A.M., Post‐conflict behaviour in long‐tailed macaques: I. the social events (1991) Ethology, 89, pp. 89-100; Aureli, F., Van Schaik, C.P., Van Hoof, J.A.‐R.‐A.M., Post‐conflict behaviour in long‐tailed macaques: II. coping with the uncertainty (1991) Ethology, 89, pp. 101-114; Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., Redirected aggression and reconciliation among vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops (1989) Behaviour, 110, pp. 258-275; Cheney, D.L., Seyfarth, R.M., (1990) How Monkeys See the World, , Univ.

Models of this category (assuming that in groups food finding by one results in food sharing by many) conclude that patch-finding rate improves with group size. Interference among individuals reduces pooled searching efficiency of the group. The author introduce a term, s, the probability of an individual's being among the ones sharing the food in a patch found by the group. Such fine-tunings prolong food-finding rates that push individuals in the group toward the foraging status of a solitary individual. With phenotype-related differences in s, foraging in groups turns out to be a less profitable option the lower an individual is ranked in the group. The option of foraging alone may easily be a better strategy than that of a low-ranking individual foraging in a group. If so, the model also suggests groups assorted by phenotype. -from Authors",,"competition; cooperation; feeding behaviour; foraging; group behaviour; group v. solo foraging",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,00030147,,,,"English",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027883921

Making use of Wright's Coefficient of Relationship as the measure of the proportion of replica genes in a relative, a quantity is found which incorporates the maximizing property of Darwinian fitness. This quantity is named ""inclusive fitness"". Species following the model should tend to evolve behaviour such that each organism appears to be attempting to maximize its inclusive fitness. This implies a limited restraint on selfish competitive behaviour and possibility of limited self-sacrifices. Special cases of the model are used to show (a) that selection in the social situations newly covered tends to be slower than classical selection, (b) how in populations of rather non-dispersive organisms the model may apply to genes affecting dispersion, and (c) how it may apply approximately to competition between relatives, for example, within sibships.
