MA95,Diversity and evolutionary patterns of bacterial gut associates of corbiculate bees,"The animal gut is a habitat for diverse communities of microorganisms (microbiota). Honeybees and bumblebees have recently been shown to harbour a distinct and species poor microbiota, which may confer protection against parasites. Here, we investigate diversity, host specificity and transmission mode of two of the most common, yet poorly known, gut bacteria of honeybees and bumblebees: Snodgrassella alvi (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella apicola (Gammaproteobacteria). We analysed 16S rRNA gene sequences of these bacteria from diverse bee host species across most of the honeybee and bumblebee phylogenetic diversity from North America, Europe and Asia. These focal bacteria were present in 92% of bumblebee species and all honeybee species but were found to be absent in the two related corbiculate bee tribes, the stingless bees (Meliponini) and orchid bees (Euglossini). Both Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola phylogenies show significant topological congruence with the phylogeny of their bee hosts, albeit with a considerable degree of putative host switches. Furthermore, we found that phylogenetic distances between Gilliamella apicola samples correlated with the geographical distance between sampling locations. This tentatively suggests that the environmental transmission rate, as set by geographical distance, affects the distribution of G. apicola infections. We show experimentally that both bacterial taxa can be vertically transmitted from the mother colony to daughter queens, and social contact with nest mates after emergence from the pupa greatly facilitates this transmission. Therefore, sociality may play an important role in vertical transmission and opens up the potential for co-evolution or at least a close association of gut bacteria with their hosts.  2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",JW,"exclude (no intraspecific trait variation, no shift in quality of interaction)",,
MA358,"Symbiosis, Introduction to","Symbiosis is the persistent association of two or more dissimilar species. This phenomenon is widespread in nature and has contributed to major transitions in the evolution of life on Earth. Symbiosis can serve as a source of evolutionary innovation. Diverse plant and animal species harbor microbial symbionts that aid their hosts in resource acquisition and defense. Symbioses can originate from diverse interaction types, and can be maintained or broken down through a variety of mechanisms. Understanding and manipulating symbioses may provide direct benefits to human health and agricultural systems.  2016 Elsevier Inc.

MA176,Heterogenistics: An epistemological restructuring of biological and social sciences,"The epistemology which sees intra-specific and intra-group heterogenization, symbiotization, interactive pattern-generating and change as basic principles produces types of theories and research strategies different from the epistemology based on the notions of intra-specific and intra-group uniformity, competition and stabilization. In the uniformistic view, individual variations have been reduced mainly either to statistical deviations from the mean or to dominance relationship. On the other hand in the heterogenistic view, mutual beneficial interactions between qualitatively heterogeneous individuals within a group is regarded as indispensable for the increase of the level of behavioral and biological sophistication and evolution. This article compares five epistemologies including the two mentioned above in the context of the current epistemological transition in science, particularly due to the emergence of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in physics and differentiation-amplifying reciprocal causal models in mathematics and engineering, both of which consider the universe as pattern-generating, information-creating and evolving.  1977 Leiden University Press/Dr. W.

MA323,Simple foraging rules in competitive environments can generate socially structured populations,"Social vertebrates commonly form foraging groups whose members repeatedly interact with one another and are often genetically related. Many species also exhibit within-population specializations, which can range from preferences to forage in particular areas through to specializing on the type of prey they catch. However, within-population structure in foraging groups, behavioral homogeneity in foraging behavior, and relatedness could be outcomes of behavioral interactions rather than underlying drivers. We present a simple process by which grouping among foragers emerges and is maintained across generations. We introduce agent-based models to investigate (1) whether a simple rule (keep foraging with the same individuals when you were successful) leads to stable social community structure, and (2) whether this structure is robust to demographic changes and becomes kin-structured over time. We find the rapid emergence of kin-structured populations and the presence of foraging groups that control, or specialize on, a particular food resource. This pattern is strongest in small populations, mirroring empirical observations. Our results suggest that group stability can emerge as a product of network self-organization and, in doing so, may provide the necessary conditions for the evolution of more sophisticated processes, such as social learning. This taxonomically general social process has implications for our understanding of the links between population, genetic, and social structures.",JW,exclude (no shift in quality of interaction),,
MA217,Intra-group relatedness affects parental and helper investment rules in offspring care,"In any system where multiple individuals jointly contribute to rearing offspring, conflict is expected to arise over the relative contributions of each carer. Existing theoretical work on the conflict over care has: (a) rarely considered the influence of tactical investment during offspring production on later contributions to offspring rearing; (b) concentrated mainly on biparental care, rather than cooperatively caring groups comprising both parents and helpers; and (c) typically ignored relatedness between carers as a potential influence on investment behavior. We use a game-theoretical approach to explore the effects of female production tactics and differing group relatedness structures on the expected rearing investment contributed by breeding females, breeding males, and helpers in cooperative groups. Our results suggest that the breeding female should pay higher costs overall when helpful helpers are present, as she produces additional offspring to take advantage of the available care. We find that helpers related to offspring through the breeding female rather than the breeding male should contribute less to care, and decrease their contribution as group size increases, because the female refrains from producing additional offspring to exploit them. Finally, within-group variation in helper relatedness also affects individual helper investment rules by inflating the differences between the contributions to care of dissimilar helpers. Our findings underline the importance of considering maternal investment decisions during offspring production to understand investment across the entire breeding attempt, and provide empirically testable predictions concerning the interplay between maternal, paternal and helper investment and how these are modified by different relatedness structures.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",JW,include,intraspecific,"male-female, theoretical/modelling"
MA236,Male reproductive skew is higher in bonobos than chimpanzees,"The two closest living relatives of humans, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), share many traits that are common in humans but rare in other mammals, including societies with high fissionfusion dynamics, male philopatry, female dispersal and extensive social bonding among unrelated individuals [1]. The major difference between these two species is that male aggression is more frequent and intense in male-dominated chimpanzees than in bonobos, where the highest-ranking individuals are female [1]. One potential explanation is that because periods of female sexual receptivity and attractiveness are more extended in bonobos [2], males compete less intensely for each mating opportunity. This would reduce the strength of selection for traits that lead to success in direct contest competition between males and in sexual coercion of females, thus increasing the potential for female choice [3]. Accordingly, it has been predicted that the influence of male dominance rank on reproductive success and the extent of male reproductive skew should be lower in bonobos than in chimpanzees [1]. Although relevant for understanding the evolution of the unusual levels of egalitarianism and cooperation found in human hunter-gatherers [4], comparative analyses in the genus Pan have been limited by the scanty paternity data available for wild bonobos [5]. Here, we show using the largest sample of paternity data available that, contrary to expectation, male bonobos have a higher reproductive skew and a stronger relationship between dominance rank and reproductive success than chimpanzees.  2017 Elsevier Ltd",JW,include,intraspecific,male-female
MA407,Volatile-mediated location of mutualist host and toxic non-host microfungi by Drosophila larvae,"In analogy to herbivores, fungivorous animals may find suitable host fungi using fungal volatiles as infochemicals and to distinguish between fungi of varying suitability. This study tests the influence of volatiles emitted by micro-fungi, yeast and mould, on the foraging behaviour of facultative fungivorous Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We hypothesised that establishing or avoiding contact with edible yeast (host fungus) and inedible, toxic mould (non-host fungus) is regulated by fungus-specific variation in volatile production. In particular, we expected the non-host fungus to produce specific volatiles that repel fly larvae and thus contribute to signal inedibility. By quantifying innate variation in arrival of individual D. melanogaster larvae at colonies of the mutualist yeast Candida californica or of the antagonistic mould Penicillium expansum, we found the yeast to attract more rapidly a larger number of larvae than the mould did. The developmental stage (young, vegetative vs. old, sporulating) of P. expansum did not affect arrival of larvae at fungal colonies. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the composition of fungal volatiles. Four compounds appeared to be yeast-specific, twenty to be mould-specific volatiles. Eight volatiles were consistently produced by both young and old P. expansum. Two compounds, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol, were released by P. expansum (young and old) as well as C. californica. Time-dependent behavioural response profiles of similar to 750 D. melanogaster larvae revealed innate attraction to three alcohols produced by yeast and/or moulds and to two yeast-specific organic acids. We found no indication of a repellent effect of mould-specific compounds, including terpenoids like geosmin known to elicit strong avoidance behaviour of adult D. melanogaster in response to harmful microbes. Also, synthetic mould and yeast-specific blends of attractive compounds were equally attractive to the larvae. With respect to the species combinations investigated in this study, we hypothesize that qualitative differences in fungal volatile profiles are of minor relevance in how Drosophila larvae locate and probably discriminate between fungi of varying suitability.",JW,exclude (no intraspecific trait variation in fungal volatiles that would change the quality of interspecific interaction) ,,
MA143,Feather mite abundance varies but symbiotic nature of mite-host relationship does not differ between two ecologically dissimilar warblers,"Feather mites are obligatory ectosymbionts of birds that primarily feed on the oily secretions from the uropygial gland. Feather mite abundance varies within and among host species and has various effects on host condition and fitness, but there is little consensus on factors that drive variation of this symbiotic system. We tested hypotheses regarding how within-species and among-species traits explain variation in both (1) mite abundance and (2) relationships between mite abundance and host body condition and components of host fitness (reproductive performance and apparent annual survival). We focused on two closely related (Parulidae), but ecologically distinct, species: Setophaga cerulea (Cerulean Warbler), a canopy dwelling open-cup nester, and Protonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler), an understory dwelling, cavity nester. We predicted that feather mites would be more abundant on and have a more parasitic relationship with P.citrea, and within P.citrea, females and older individuals would harbor greater mite abundances. We captured, took body measurements, quantified feather mite abundance on individuals primaries and rectrices, and monitored individuals and their nests to estimate fitness. Feather mite abundance differed by species, but in the opposite direction of our prediction. There was no relationship between mite abundance and any measure of body condition or fitness for either species or sex (also contrary to our predictions). Our results suggest that species biology and ecological context may influence mite abundance on hosts. However, this pattern does not extend to differential effects of mites on measures of host body condition or fitness.  2017 The Authors.

MA352,State-dependent sentinels: an experimental study in the Arabian babbler,"Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers. Turdoides squamiceps have proven consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply hy individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately fed a supplement of mealworms each for one day at a time. Control days before and after each treatment confirmed that Ilo carry-over effects occurred, and that most normal sentinel activity was carried our by alpha males, then beta males and then by. the rest of the group. When supplemented. both alpha and beta males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity relative to control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences in individual bod! mass within groups reflected natural and experimental variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for an); increased interference between malts during the supplementation treatments. These results therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to cooperative sentinel behaviour.",JW,include,intraspecific,social behavior
MA118,Emergence of ratio-dependent and predator-dependent functional responses for pollination mutualism and seed parasitism,"Prey (N) dependence {[}g(N)], predator (P) dependence {[}g(P) or g(N,P)], and ratio dependence {[}f(P/N)] are often seen as contrasting forms of the predator's functional response describing predator consumption rates on prey resources in predator-prey and parasitoid-host interactions. Analogously, prey-, predator-, and ratio-dependent functional responses are apparently alternative functional responses for other types of consumer-resource interactions. These include, for example, the fraction of flowers pollinated or seeds parasitized in pollination (pre-dispersal) seed-parasitism mutualisms, such as those between fig wasps and fig trees or yucca moths and yucca plants. Here we examine the appropriate functional responses for how the fraction of flowers pollinated and seeds parasitized vary with the density of pollinators (predator dependence) or the ratio of pollinator and flower densities (ratio dependence). We show that both types of functional responses can emerge from minor, but biologically important variations on a single model. An individual-based model was first used to describe plant-pollinator interactions. Conditional upon on whether the number of flowers visited by the pollinator was limited by factors other than search time (e.g., by the number of eggs it had to lay, if it was also a seed parasite), and on whether the pollinator could directly find flowers on a plant, or had to search, the simulation results lead to either a predator-dependent or a ratio-dependent functional response. An analytic model was then used to show mathematically how these two cases can arise. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.",JW,include,interspecific,"predator-prey, theoretical/modelling"
MA126,Evolution of equal division among unequal partners,"One of the hallmarks of human fairness is its insensitivity to power: although strong individuals are often in a position to coerce weak individuals, fairness requires them to share the benefits of cooperation equally. The existence of such egalitarianism is poorly explained by current evolutionary models. We present a model based on cooperation and partner choice that can account for the emergence of a psychological disposition toward fairness, whatever the balance of power between the cooperative partners. We model the evolution of the division of a benefit in an interaction similar to an ultimatum game, in a population made up of individuals of variable strength. The model shows that strong individuals will not receive any advantage from their strength, instead having to share the benefits of cooperation equally with weak individuals at the evolutionary equilibrium, a result that is robust to variations in population size and the proportion of weak individuals. We discuss how this model suggests an explanation for why egalitarian behaviors toward everyone, including the weak, should be more likely to evolve in humans than in any other species.",JW,include,intraspecific,"social behavior, theoretical/modelling"
MA300,Recombination and selection shape the molecular diversity pattern of nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium sp associated to Medicago,"We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample, from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species, within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes. Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus, recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different loci.",JW,"exclude (no intraspecific trait variation, no shift in quality of interaction)",,
MA343,Spare to share? How does interindividual variation in metabolic rate influence food sharing in the honeybee?,"A central benefit of group living is the cooperative acquisition and sharing of resources but the costs associated with these processes can set up a potential conflict between individual and group level fitness. Within a honeybee colony, the task of resource acquisition is relegated to the foragers and any interindividual differences in their metabolic rate and the consequent carbohydrate demand may pose a constraint on the amount of resources they can contribute to the colony. We investigated whether the carbohydrate demand of a forager is a function of her metabolic rate and if this impacts the amount of food she shares with the nestmates. Our results show that the sucrose consumption rates of foragers with high metabolic rates did not meet their carbohydrate demand, placing them at an energy deficit while those with lower metabolic rates had an energy surplus. Our food sharing experiments showed a trend but did not detect a significant difference among individuals with different consumption rates in terms of the amount of food they shared with their nestmates. These results suggest that honeybee foragers with different metabolic rates are likely to differ in terms of whether they have an energy surplus or deficit, but more long-term datasets may be required to detect how this may influence food sharing.",JW,include,intraspecific,social behavior
MA282,Plant geographic phenotypic variation drives diversification in its associated community of a phytophagous insect and its parasitoids,"Background: While the communities constituted by phytophageous insects and their parasites may represent half of all terrestrial animal species, understanding their diversification remains a major challenge. A neglected idea is that geographic phenotypic variation in a host plant may lead to heterogeneous evolutionary responses of the different members of the associated communities. This could result in diversification on a host plant by ecological speciation in some species, leading to geographic variation in community composition. In this study we investigated geographic variation of inflorescence receptacle size in a plant, Ficus hirta, and how the hymenopteran community feeding in the inflorescences has responded. Our predictions were: 1) Inflorescence size variation affects wasp species differently depending on how they access oviposition sites. 2) In some affected lineages of wasps, we may observe vicariant, parapatric species adapted to different inflorescence sizes. Results: We show that fig (the enclosed inflorescence of Ficus) wall thickness varies geographically. The fig entering pollinating wasp was not affected, while the parasites ovipositing through the fig wall were. Two parapatric species of Philotrypesis, exhibiting strikingly different ovipositor lengths, were recorded. One species of Sycoscapter was also present, and it was restricted, like the shorter-ovipositor Philotrypesis, to the geographic zone where fig walls were thinner. Conclusions: Previous work on fig wasps suggested that parapatric geographic ranges among congenerics were due to adaptation to variation in abiotic factors, complemented by interspecific competition. Our results show that parapatric ranges may also result from adaptation to variation in biotic factors. Within an insect community, differences among species in their response to geographic phenotypic variation of their host plant may result in geographically heterogeneous community structure. Such heterogeneity leads to heterogeneous interaction networks among sites. Our results support the hypothesis that plant geographic phenotypic variation can be a driver of diversification in associated insect communities, and can complement other diversification processes.",JW,include,interspecific,parasite-host
MA84,Culture and the evolution of social learning,"Applications of modern evolutionary theory to human culture have generated several different theoretical approaches that challenge traditional anthropological perspectives. `'Cultural selection'' and `'mind parasite'' theories model culture as an independent evolutionary system because transmission of cultural traits via social learning is distinct from transmission of genes via DNA replication, `'Dual-inheritance'' and `'co-evolution'' theories model culture as an intermediary evolutionary process that involves information from two inheritance systems: genetics and social learning, `'Evolutionary psychology'' theories emphasize that the evolutionary history of natural selection on mental processes links culture and biological adaptation; hence, cultural information is viewed as part of the organic phenotype and not an independent evolutionary system, Cross-cultural universals and scenarios of the `'environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' are used to identify characteristics of the `'evolved mind'' (human nature). `'Behavioral ecology'' theories examine relations between behavior and environmental context, Behavioral/cultural variations are viewed as products of flexible decision-making processes (evolved mind) that may respond adaptively to micro-environmental differences, It is difficult to devise empirical tests that distinguish among these theories, because they share many basic premises and make similar predictions about human behavior. Indeed, some of the apparent differences may be more semantic than substantive. Social learning is the key process underlying these evolutionary paradigms, Here I argue that human learning mechanisms are products of natural selection, and hence process information in ways that reflect evolutionary design, I review common objections to this hypothesis, including (1) learning processes are uncoupled from genetics and biological adaptation; (2) culture (or its effects) is partly extrasomatic; (3) culture, by most definitions, involves mental phenomena, including conscious thought; (4) culture involves the use of arbitrary symbols to communicate information; (5) culture appears to have emergent properties at the group level, such as shared values and beliefs resulting in political and religious institutions; (6) culture involves historical processes; and (7) complex culture is uniquely human-we need an explanation for why the human species alone evolved such extensive social learning aptitudes. I suggest that these controversies can be resolved, although empirical tests are difficult. I posit that social competition was a primary selective pressure on human mental abilities (Alexander 1989) and that this favored domain-general, constructivist learning capabilities (e.g., Quartz and Sejnowski, in press) that can manage context-dependent analysis and integrate information from domain-specific mechanisms (Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994; MacDonald 1991; Sperber 1996). Humans are unique in the extraordinary levels of novelty that are generated by the processing of socially learned information. Human culture is cumulative; human cognition produces new ideas built upon the old. To a degree that far surpasses that of any other species, human mental processes must contend with a constantly changing information environment of their own creation. Cultural information may be especially dynamic because it is a fundamental aspect of human social competition. Apparently arbitrary changes in cultural traits, such as clothing styles, music, art, food, dialects, and so forth, may reflect information arms races among social competitors. The remarkable developmental plasticity and cross domain integration of some cognitive mechanisms may be products of selection for special sensitivity to variable social context. Human `'culture'' is not just a pool or source of information; it is an arena and theater of social manipulation and competition. Studies of human behavior-including language, kinship, mating relationships, subsistence, economics, and politics-generally are consistent with an evolutionary basis for social learning, but often they fail to add specific new knowledge about the mechanisms. Analyses of cognitive aptitudes underlying language, kinship, and so forth, often are inconclusive because cultural information (and consequent behavior) involves complex interaction among history, environmental variation, ontogenetic pathways of mental processes, and specific context. I suggest that empirical tests of evolutionary culture theory must build upon identification of apparent universals and examine individual variability by incorporating developmental psychology, environmental conditions, and social and historical context. This synthesis would benefit from enhanced cooperation between cognitive psychologists and cultural anthropologists.

MA402,Variance-sensitive green woodhoopoes: A new explanation for sex differences in foraging?,"Studies of cooperatively breeding birds rarely benefit from the extensive research on adaptive foraging behaviour, despite the potential for concepts such as state-dependent foraging to explain many aspects of behaviour in social groups. For example, sex differences in preferred foraging techniques used by green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, have previously been explained by sexual dimorphism in bill length and the benefits afforded by foraging specialization and niche differentiation within cooperative groups. Contrary to this argument, there were no sex differences in mean foraging success and/or prey size captured when males and females used the same foraging techniques. Subordinates of both sexes did experience lower and more varied foraging success compared with dominants, but probably only as a consequence of competition or inexperience. However, dominant males experienced greater variance in individual foraging success compared with dominant females, and dominant males also experienced greater variances in prey size when using their preferred foraging techniques. Dominant males therefore appeared to specialize in foraging techniques that provided more variable rewards, whilst dominant females consistently chose to minimize variation in reward. Dominant females also experienced less variance in foraging returns when using the same techniques as males, suggesting a possible link with sexual dimorphism in bill length. Partitioning of foraging niches in dominant green woodhoopoes therefore appears to be better explained by sex differences in variance (risk) sensitivity to foraging rewards. We suggest that this kind of detailed analysis of state-dependent foraging has the potential to explain many of the crucial age and sex differences in behaviour within cooperative groups.  2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",JW,include,intraspecific,"social behavior, male-female"
MA5,A Hypervariable Invertebrate Allodeterminant,"Colonial marine invertebrates, such as sponges, corals, bryozoans, and ascidians, often live in densely populated communities where they encounter other members of their species as they grow over their substratum. Such encounters typically lead to a natural histocompatibility response in which colonies either fuse to become a single, chimeric colony or reject and aggressively compete for space. These allorecognition phenomena mediate intraspecific competition [1-3], support allotypic diversity [4], control the level atwhich selection acts [5-8], and resemble allogeneic interactions in pregnancy and transplantation [9-12]. Despite the ubiquity of allorecognition in colonial phyla, however, its molecular basis has not been identified beyond what is currently known about histocompatibility in vertebrates and protochordates. We positionally cloned an allorecognition gene by using inbred strains of the cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which is a model system for the study of invertebrate allorecognition. The gene identified encodes a putative transmembrane receptor expressed in all tissues capable of allorecognition that is highly polymorphic and predicts allorecognition responses in laboratory and field-derived strains. This study reveals that a previously undescribed hypervariable molecule bearing three extracellular domains with greatest sequence similarity to the immunoglobulin superfamily is an allodeterminant in a lower metazoan.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

MA263,On the reorganization of fitness during evolutionary transitions in individuality,"The basic problem in an evolutionary transition is to understand how a group of individuals becomes a new kind of individual, possessing the property of heritable variation in fitness at the new level of organization. During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual. We use the volvocalean green algal group as a model-system to understand evolutionary transitions in individuality and to apply and test the theoretical principles presented above. Lastly, we discuss how the different notions of individuality stem from the basic properties of fitness in a multilevel selection context.",JW,include,intraspecific,parasite-host/autoimmune disease
