A commentary on domestic animals as dual-purpose models that benefit agricultural and biomedical research,"Research on domestic animals (cattle, swine, sheep, goats, poultry, horses, and aquatic species) at land grant institutions is integral to improving the global competitiveness of US animal agriculture and to resolving complex animal and human diseases. However, dwindling federal and state budgets, years of stagnant funding from USDA for the Competitive State Research, Education, and Extension Service National Research Initiative (CSREES-NRI) Competitive Grants Program, significant reductions in farm animal species and in numbers at land grant institutions, and declining enrollment for graduate studies in animal science are diminishing the resources necessary to conduct research on domestic species. Consequently, recruitment of scientists who use such models to conduct research relevant to animal agriculture and biomedicine at land grant institutions is in jeopardy. Concerned stakeholders have addressed this critical problem by conducting workshops, holding a series of meetings with USDA and National Institutes of Health (NIH) officials, and developing a white paper to propose solutions to obstacles impeding the use of domestic species as dual-purpose animal models for high-priority problems common to agriculture and biomedicine. In addition to shortfalls in research support and human resources, overwhelming use of mouse models in biomedicine, lack of advocacy from university administrators, long-standing cultural barriers between agriculture and human medicine, inadequate grantsmanship by animal scientists, and a scarcity of key reagents and resources are major roadblocks to progress. Solutions will require a large financial enhancement of USDA's Competitive Grants Program, educational programs geared toward explaining how research using agricultural animals benefits both animal agriculture and human health, and the development of a new mind-set in land grant institutions that fosters greater cooperation among basic and applied researchers. Recruitment of outstanding scientists dedicated to using domestic animal models for agricultural and biomedical research, strong incentives for scientists to take advantage of training opportunities to write NIH grants, and greater NIH and USDA cooperation to sponsor the use of agricultural animals as dual-purpose animal models that benefit agriculture and biomedicine will also be necessary. In conclusion, the broad diversity of animal models needed for agricultural and biomedical research is at risk unless research priorities at the land grant uni-versities are critically evaluated and financial support for such research is dramatically increased. 2008 American Society of Animal Science.

A common framework for identifying linkage rules across different types of interactions,"1. Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of bio-diversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. 2. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. 3. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. 4. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator-prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore-plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant-pollinator systems). 5. Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.",MA2,NM,include,interspecific,predator-prey; plant-herbivore; pollinator-plant
A Hypervariable Invertebrate Allodeterminant,"Colonial marine invertebrates, such as sponges, corals, bryozoans, and ascidians, often live in densely populated communities where they encounter other members of their species as they grow over their substratum. Such encounters typically lead to a natural histocompatibility response in which colonies either fuse to become a single, chimeric colony or reject and aggressively compete for space. These allorecognition phenomena mediate intraspecific competition [1-3], support allotypic diversity [4], control the level atwhich selection acts [5-8], and resemble allogeneic interactions in pregnancy and transplantation [9-12]. Despite the ubiquity of allorecognition in colonial phyla, however, its molecular basis has not been identified beyond what is currently known about histocompatibility in vertebrates and protochordates. We positionally cloned an allorecognition gene by using inbred strains of the cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which is a model system for the study of invertebrate allorecognition. The gene identified encodes a putative transmembrane receptor expressed in all tissues capable of allorecognition that is highly polymorphic and predicts allorecognition responses in laboratory and field-derived strains. This study reveals that a previously undescribed hypervariable molecule bearing three extracellular domains with greatest sequence similarity to the immunoglobulin superfamily is an allodeterminant in a lower metazoan.  2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A symbionts dispersal strategy: Condition-dependent dispersal underlies predictable variation in direct transmission among hosts,"Direct horizontal transmission of pathogenic and mutualistic symbionts has profound consequences for host and symbiont fitness alike. While the importance of contact rates for transmission is widely recognized, the processes that underlie variation in transmission during contact are rarely considered. Here, we took a symbiont's perspective of transmission as a form of dispersal and adopted the concept of condition-dependent dispersal strategies from the study of free-living organisms to understand and predict variation in transmission in the cleaning symbiosis between crayfish and ectosymbiotic branchiobdellidan worms. Field study showed that symbiont reproductive success was correlated with host size and competition among worms for microhabitats. Laboratory experiments demonstrated high variability in transmission among host contacts. Moreover, symbionts were more likely to disperse when host size and competition for microhabitat created a fitness environment below a discrete minimum threshold. A predictive model based on a condition-dependent symbiont dispersal strategy correctly predicted transmission in 95% of experimental host encounters and the exact magnitude of transmission in 67%, both significantly better than predictions that assumed a fixed transmission rate. Our work provides a dispersal-based understanding of symbiont transmission and suggests adaptive symbiont dispersal strategies can explain variation in transmission dynamics and complex patterns of host infection.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Adaptations for social cognition in the primate brain,"Studies of the factors affecting reproductive success in group-living monkeys have traditionally focused on competitive traits, like the acquisition of high dominance rank. Recent research, however, indicates that the ability to form cooperative social bonds has an equally strong effect on fitness. Two implications follow. First, strong social bonds make individuals fitness inter- dependent and the free-rider problem disappears. Second, individuals must make adaptive choices that balance competition and cooperationoften with the same partners. The proximate mechanisms underlying these behaviours are only just beginning to be understood. Recent results from cognitive and systems neuroscience provide us some evidence that many social and non- social decisions are mediated ultimately by abstract, domain-general neural mechanisms. However, other populations of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala and parietal cortex specifically encode the type, importance and value of social information. Whether these specialized popu- lations of neurons arise by selection or through developmental plasticity in response to the challenges of social life remains unknown. Many brain areas are homologous and show similar patterns of activity in human and non- human primates. In both groups, cortical activity is modulated by hormones like oxytocin and by the action of certain genes that may affect individual differences in behaviour. Taken together, results suggest that differences in cooperation between the two groups are a matter of degree rather than constituting a fundamental, qualitative distinction.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Allometry of animal-microbe interactions and global census of animal-associated microbes,"Animals live in close association with microorganisms, mostly prokaryotes, living in or on them as commensals, mutualists or parasites, and profoundly affecting host fitness. Most animal-microbe studies focus on microbial community structure; for this project, allometry (scaling of animal attributes with animal size) was applied to animal-microbe relationships across a range of species spanning 12 orders of magnitude in animal mass, from nematodes to whales. Microbial abundances per individual animal were gleaned from published literature and also microscopically counted in three species. Abundance of prokaryotes/individual versus animal mass scales as a nearly linear power function (exponent = 1.07, R =0.94). Combining this power function with allometry of animal abundance indicates that macrofauna have an outsized share of animal-associated microorganisms. The total number of animal-associated prokaryotes in Earths land animals was calculated to be 1.3-1.4 x 102 cells and the total of marine animal-associated microbes was calculated to be 8.6-9.0 x 10 cells. Animal-associated microbes thus total 2.1-2.3 x 102 of the approximately 10 prokaryotes on the Earth. Microbes associated with humans comprise 3.3-3.5% of Earths animal-associated microbes, and domestic animals harbour 14-20% of all animal-associated microbes, adding a new dimension to the scale of human impact on the biosphere. This novel allometric power function may reflect underlying mechanisms involving the transfer of energy and materials between microorganisms and their animal hosts. Microbial diversity indices of animal gut communities and gut microbial species richness for 60 mammals did not indicate significant scaling relationships with animal body mass; however, further research in this area is warranted.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Are bryophyte communities different from higher-plant communities? Abundance relations,"The considerable differences in biology between bryophytes and higher plants have led to speculation that their community structure might be different. Ten bryophyte communities were sampled for species biomass composition, and for comparison ten higher-plant communities that were similar in physiognomy and in total community biomass. The rather insecure theory in the bryophyte literature was distilled into eight quantifiable predictions, which were tested. For seven, there was no sign of the predicted differences: i.e. no indication of the predicted low within-community heterogeneity, higher species richness, more variable species richness, lower rank consistency, a poor fit for the geometric model of RAD (relative abundance distribution), better fit for the broken-stick and general-lognormal RAD models with general-lognormal parameter gamma deviating further from 1.0, or of a good fit for the Zipf-Mandelbrot RAD model. However, evenness was, on average, significantly (p=0.005) less in the bryophyte communities, using any of four evenness indices. Two possible features of bryophytes are suggested that might cause this: (a) a smaller module (i.e. shoot, leaf) size, allowing species to be present with a lower threshold biomass, and (b) less efficient competitive exclusion among bryophytes because of weaker competition and a predominance of mutualism, as suggested in the literature. However, the striking conclusion from the results is that in spite of all the biological differences between the two groups of organisms, their community organisation is remarkably similar.",MA23,NM,exclude,,
ARE THERE GENERAL-PRINCIPLES OF SIGNAL-DESIGN,"Explanations of signal design must meet three requirements: they must be logically coherent, they must explain the diversity in size of animal signals and they must explain the diversity in form of signals. Three selection pressures operating on animal signals are discussed: the degree of conflict or cooperation, the `efficacy' of signals and how signalling costs are paid. A distinction is made between cases where costs of signalling are paid in the production of the signal and cases where costs are paid as a consequence of giving a signal on the grounds that differences in signal design result. This is illustrated by reference to the example of warning coloration. It is concluded that general principles still elude us because of the numbers of different selection pressures that operate on the design of animal signals.",MA24,NM,exclude,,
Bacterial symbionts as mediators of ecologically important traits of insect hosts,"1. Bacterial symbionts play a prominent role in insect nutritional ecology by aiding in digestion of food or providing nutrients that are limited or lacking in the diet. Thereby, endosymbionts open niches to their insect host that would otherwise be unavailable. 2. Currently, several other ecologically relevant traits mediated by endosymbionts are being investigated, including enhanced parasite resistance, enhanced heat tolerance, and influences on insect-plant interactions such as manipulation of plant physiology to the benefit of the insect. 3. Traits mediated by endosymbionts are often identified by correlative studies where traits are found to be altered in the presence of a particular symbiont. Recent developments in genomic tools offer the opportunity for studying the impact of bacteria-insect symbioses under natural conditions in a population and community ecology context. In vivo experiments specifically testing putative functions of endosymbionts in parallel to population-level studies on the prevalence of endosymbionts allow disentangling host versus symbiont contribution to phenotypic variability observed in individuals. Effects of symbionts on host phenotype are often large and relevant to host fitness, e.g. by significantly enhancing survival or fecundity in a context-dependent manner. 4. Predominantly vertically transmitted endosymbionts contribute to the heritable genetic variation present in a host species. Phenotypic variation on which selection can act may be due to differences either among host genomes, symbiont genomes, or genotype  genotype interactions. Therefore the holobiont, i.e. the host including all symbionts, should be regarded as the unit of selection as the association between host and symbionts may affect the fitness of the holobiont depending on the environment.  2011 The Author.

Benefiting friends or dominants: prosocial choices mainly depend on rank position in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis),"Long-term observational studies in a number of animal species suggest that exchange patterns of social acts depend on long-term emotional bonds. Therefore, it is expected that the frequency of prosocial behavior will depend on the strength of such a bond. In this study we tested whether variation in relationship quality among unrelated individuals, i.e., ``friends{''} and ``nonfriends,{''} is predictive of the prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques in two experiments. First, we related relationship quality to prosociality in a dyadic prosociality test, and second, we gave subjects the choice to give to either a friend or a nonfriend in a triadic choice test. We show that prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques in the dyadic test is not related to relationship quality. When given the choice to give to either a friend or a nonfriend in the triadic test, there is a minor indication that long-tailed macaques show a preference to give to their friends, yet this indication is neither significant nor consistent. In contrast, subordinate long-tailed macaques make a more ``competitive{''} choice and avoid giving to the individual closest in rank. Therefore, in the short-term situation of experimental tests, prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques seems unaffected by the relationship quality of the dyad/triad tested, and the relative dominance position of these dyads/triads seems to have a much stronger effect on their prosocial behavior.",MA33,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks
Bet hedging based cooperation can limit kin selection and form a basis for mutualism,"Mutualism is a mechanism of cooperation in which partners that differ help each other. As such, mutualism opposes mechanisms of kin selection and tag-based selection (for example the green beard mechanism), which are based on giving exclusive help to partners that are related or carry the same tag. In contrast to kin selection, which is a basis for parochialism and intergroup warfare, mutualism can therefore be regarded as a mechanism that drives peaceful coexistence between different groups and individuals. Here the competition between mutualism and kin (tag) selection is studied. In a model where kin selection and tag-based selection are dominant, mutualism is promoted by introducing environmental fluctuations. These fluctuations cause reduction in reproductive success by the mechanism of variance discount. The best strategy to counter variance discount is to share with agents who experience the most anticorrelated fluctuations, a strategy called bet hedging. In this way, bet hedging stimulates cooperation with the most unrelated partners, which is a basis for mutualism. Analytic results and simulations reveal that, if this effect is large enough, mutualistic strategies can dominate kin selective strategies. In addition, mutants of these mutualistic strategies that experience fluctuations that are more anticorrelated to their partner, can outcompete wild type, which can lead to the evolution of specialization. In this way, the evolutionary success of mutualistic strategies can be explained by bet hedging-based cooperation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Capuchin monkeys (Sapajus {[}Cebus] apella) play Nash equilibria in dynamic games, but their decisions are likely not influenced by oxytocin","Comparative approaches to experimental economics have shed light on the evolution of social decision-making across a range of primate species, including humans. Here we replicate our previous work looking at six pairs of capuchin monkeys' (Sapajus {[}Cebus] apella) responses to scenarios requiring both coordination (Assurance Game) and anti-coordination (Hawk-Dove Game). This then provides a foundation for assessing their responses to two additional games, one with a scenario of beneficial cooperation with a temptation to defect (Prisoner's Dilemma) and one with an environment requiring changing strategies within short temporal proximity (Alternating Economic Game). We additionally explored the effects of exogenous oxytocin on decision-making. Oxytocin did not affect decisions in any of our games. Results from the first two games largely replicated our previous findings. Responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma were more varied than was seen in previous games, with pairs respectively cooperating, defecting, and failing to establish stable strategies. Such variability indicates that this game may be a good assay for individual differences in social decision-making. Finally, capuchins were able to flexibly switch between their previously established strategies within each of the different games, even when the games were presented within the same session, requiring strategy adjustments within short temporal proximity. These results build on earlier findings showing that capuchins can alter decision-making strategies as the context demands, which is likely essential for decision-making in naturally occurring contexts.",MA39,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social decision making
Cell communities and robustness in development,"The robustness of patterning events in development is a key feature that must be accounted for in proposed models of these events. When considering explicitly cellular systems, robustness can be exhibited at different levels of organization. Consideration of two widespread patterning mechanisms suggests that robustness at the level of cell communities can result from variable development at the level of individual cells; models of these mechanisms show how interactions between participating cells guarantee community-level robustness. Cooperative interactions enhance homogeneity within communities of like cells and the sharpness of boundaries between communities of distinct cells, while competitive interactions amplify small inhomogeneities within communities of initially equivalent cells, resulting in fine-grained patterns of cell specialization.

"Chilli-briquettes modify the temporal behaviour of elephants, but not their numbers","Crop loss to foraging elephants is one of the most significant causes of conflict between people and elephants in areas where wild elephants share resources with people. Effective solutions to reduce the effects of human-elephant conflict on local livelihoods are thus essential to foster coexistence between elephants and people. We assessed the effectiveness of chilli-briquettes (bricks made of dry chilli, elephant dung and water) in altering elephants use of space in the eastern Okavango Panhandle, Botswana. We burned > 600 briquettes during the night over a 2-month period to test five treatments: Frequent burning of (1) chilli and (2) chilli-free briquettes, occasional burning of (3) chilli and (4) chilli-free briquettes, and (5) a control treatment. Using camera traps and footprint surveys we assessed the number of elephants that used experimental sites, and the times at which they did so. We found elephants changed their movement behaviour from predominantly nocturnal to diurnal in areas where chilli-briquettes were burned throughout the night; however, there was no difference in the mean numbers of individuals between treatments with and without chillies. In other words, chilli-briquettes had a repellent but not a deterrent effect on elephants, keeping them away only at times when chilli-briquettes were smouldering. Based on these findings we recommend the use of chilli-briquettes as a method to deter elephants in the short term. In the long term, chilli-briquettes should be applied in combination with other larger-scale mitigation approaches, such as land management and cooperative community-based tools.  2017 Fauna and Flora International.",MA45,NM,exclude,,
Coalitions destabilize dyadic dominance relationships in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus),"Dyadic agonistic dominance relationships are thought to result from asymmetries in both intrinsic and extrinsic power. One form of extrinsic power is the ability to solicit agonistic support from other individuals. In extreme cases extrinsic power differences may override intrinsic power differences so that physically inferior individuals attain rank positions above stronger competitors. In other cases superior extrinsic power in physically inferior individuals may destabilize the otherwise clear dominance relationships. We tested this prediction with observational data on adult males in one of three free-ranging groups of Barbary macaques at Affenberg Salem, Germany. All prime males that were subjects of this study were at least 5-8 years (average 10 years) younger than the old post-prime males that were all subordinate to them. Assuming large age differences to reflect large intrinsic/physical power differences, interactions between these prime and the old males allowed investigation of the separate effects of intrinsic and extrinsic power asymmetries on dominance relationships. We estimated relationship instability using four different estimates (counter aggression, conflicts initiated by aggression from the subordinate, spontaneous submissions by dominants, and decided conflicts won by the subordinate). Relationship instability did not decrease with increasing asymmetry in intrinsic power. Instead, all four measures of relationship instability were positively related to the number of times the dominant in a dyad was target of destabilizing coalitions. Destabilizing coalitions targeted dominant males in old male-prime male dyads more often than in old male-old male dyads. Consequently, old males had less stable relationships with the much stronger prime males than with each other. We conclude that extrinsic power asymmetries predicted the instability of dyadic dominance relationships and may systematically override intrinsic power asymmetries.",MA48,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks
Codivergence and multiple host species use by fig wasp populations of the Ficus pollination mutualism,"Background: The interaction between insects and plants takes myriad forms in the generation of spectacular diversity. In this association a species host range is fundamental and often measured using an estimate of phylogenetic concordance between species. Pollinating fig wasps display extreme host species specificity, but the intraspecific variation in empirical accounts of host affiliation has previously been underestimated. In this investigation, lineage delimitation and codiversification tests are used to generate and discuss hypotheses elucidating on pollinating fig wasp associations with Ficus. Results: Statistical parsimony and AMOVA revealed deep divergences at the COI locus within several pollinating fig wasp species that persist on the same host Ficus species. Changes in branching patterns estimated using the generalized mixed Yule coalescent test indicated lineage duplication on the same Ficus species. Conversely, Elisabethiella and Alfonsiella fig wasp species are able to reproduce on multiple, but closely related host fig species. Tree reconciliation tests indicate significant codiversification as well as significant incongruence between fig wasp and Ficus phylogenies. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate more relaxed pollinating fig wasp host specificity than previously appreciated. Evolutionarily conservative host associations have been tempered by horizontal transfer and lineage duplication among closely related Ficus species. Independent and asynchronistic diversification of pollinating fig wasps is best explained by a combination of both sympatric and allopatric models of speciation. Pollinator host preference constraints permit reproduction on closely related Ficus species, but uncertainty of the frequency and duration of these associations requires better resolution.",MA49,NM,include,interspecific,pollinator-plant
Collective action problem in heterogeneous groups,"I review the theoretical and experimental literature on the collective action problem in groups whose members differ in various characteristics affecting individual costs, benefits and preferences in collective actions. I focus on evolutionary models that predict how individual efforts and fitnesses, group efforts and the amount of produced collective goods depend on the groups size and heterogeneity, as well as on the benefit and cost functions and parameters. I consider collective actions that aim to overcome the challenges from nature or win competition with neighbouring groups of co-specifics. I show that the largest contributors towards production of collective goods will typically be group members with the highest stake in it or for whom the effort is least costly, or those who have the largest capability or initial endowment. Under some conditions, such group members end up with smaller net pay-offs than the rest of the group. That is, they effectively behave as altruists. With weak nonlinearity in benefit and cost functions, the group effort typically decreases with group size and increases with within-group heterogeneity. With strong nonlinearity in benefit and cost functions, these patterns are reversed. I discuss the implications of theoretical results for animal behaviour, human origins and psychology.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Communal range defence in primates as a public goods dilemma,"Classic socio-ecological theory holds that the occurrence of aggressive range defence is primarily driven by ecological incentives, most notably by the economic defendability of an area or the resources it contains. While this ecological cost-benefit framework has great explanatory power in solitary or pair-living species, comparative work on group-living primates has always found economic defendability to be a necessary, but not sufficient condition to account for the distribution of effective range defence across the taxon. This mismatch between theory and observation has recently been ascribed to a collective action problem among group members in, what is more informatively viewed as, a public goods dilemma: mounting effective defence of a communal range against intrusions by outgroup conspecifics. We here further develop this framework, and report on analyses at three levels of biological organization: across species, across populations within a single lineage and across groups and individuals within a single population. We find that communal range defence in primates very rarely involves collective action sensu stricto and that it is best interpreted as the outcome of opportunistic and strategic individual-level decisions. Whether the public good of a defended communal range is produced by solitary, joint or collective action is thus the outcome of the interplay between the unique characteristics of each individual, local and current socio-ecological conditions, and fundamental life-history traits of the species.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Community-wide consequences of sexual dimorphism: evidence from nectar microbes in dioecious plants,"Intraspecific trait variation is receiving renewed interest as a factor affecting the structure of multi-species communities within and across trophic levels. One pervasive form of intraspecific trait variation is sexual dimorphism in animals and plants, which might exert large effects particularly on the communities of host-associated organisms, but the extent of these effects is not well understood. We investigated whether host-associated microbial communities developed differently in the floral nectar of female and male individuals of the dioecious shrubs, Eurya emarginata and E.japonica. We found that nectar-colonizing microbes such as bacteria and fungi were more than twice as prevalent and, overall, more than 10 times as abundant in male flowers as in female flowers. Microbial species composition also differed between flower sexes. To examine potential mechanisms behind these differences, we manipulated the frequency of flower visitation by animals and the order of arrival of microbial species to nectar. Animal visitation frequency affected microbial communities more greatly in male flowers, while arrival order affected them more in female flowers. These sex-specific effects appeared attributable to differences in how animals and microbes altered the chemical characteristics of nectar that limited microbial growth. Taken together, our results provide evidence that sexual dimorphism can have large effects on the structure of host-associated communities.  2018 by the Ecological Society of America",MA56,NM,exclude,,
Competition in a group of equal foragers,"Using techniques from renewal process theory, we build a stochastic model for gain accumulation in a group of equal competitors foraging in a patchy environment. The model for gain of the individuals is based on the waiting times between subsequent prey encounters by the group. These waiting times depend on the number of foragers in the group. A single parameter of this dependency encompasses a variety of foraging scenarios, from cooperation to scramble. With constant patch size, correlations between gains of any pair of foragers are negative. This dependency is most intense in small groups. Increased variation in patch size makes correlations in gains between group members positive irrespective of the group size. For a solitary forager, variance in gain approaches zero with increasing time in the patch. For an individual member in a group, variance grows monotonically. Thus, depending on the patch departure rule controlling the time to be spent in the patch, solitary foragers may have a smaller variance in gain than members in a group. As solitary foragers also potentially harvest all prey in the patch, it is hard to believe that grouping behavior would evolve solely on the basis of foraging.",MA61,NM,exclude,,
COMPETITION VERSUS COOPERATION - SUCCESS OF INDIVIDUALS FORAGING ALONE AND IN GROUPS,"Using a variant of information-sharing models, we examine the pros and cons of group foraging against the alternative of staying alone. Models of this category-assuming that in groups food finding by one results in food sharing by many-conclude that patch-finding rate improves with group size. In our modification interference among individuals reduces pooled searching efficiency of the group. We introduce a term, s, the probability of an individual's being among the ones sharing the food in a patch found by the group. Not unexpectedly, these fine-tunings prolong food-finding rates that push individuals in the group toward the foraging status of a solitary individual. With phenotype-related differences in s, foraging in groups turns out to be a less profitable option the lower an individual is ranked in the group. The model suggests that, in terms of food finding, individuals have to pay attention to their performance in the foraging group. The option of foraging alone may easily be a better strategy than that of a low-ranking individual foraging in a group. If so, the model also suggests groups assorted by phenotype.",MA62,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks; feeding-foraging
Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle,"Current work on cooperation is focused on the theory of reciprocal altruism. However, reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples. Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited. I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour. Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non-altruists may become ostracized. I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity. Altruism may be rewarded in kind, but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all, for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates. This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity. I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality, as proposed by the handicap principle. I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers. I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished.",MA63,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks
Complex network representation of multiagent systems with cooperative and competitive interactions,"The dynamic behavior of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is analyzed in the context of a modifed Lotka-Volterra model. The interaction strength is determined by the difference of agent sizes: as the difference increases, the interaction is weaker. Competitive and cooperative scenarios are analyzed, showing clusters of agents in the stationary state. However, meantime in the competitive scenario the agent sizes are constrained to be non greater than the capacity value ( = 1), in the cooperative scenario, they are allowed to exceed such capacity making clear the advantages of cooperation. The complex network representation is introduced in order to enhance the role of agent sizes and their one-on-one interactions in the dynamic behavior of the system.  2014 by the Author.",MA67,NM,include,both,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks; feeding-foraging
Conditional mutualism between allodynerus delphinalis (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and ensliniella parasitica (Astigmata: Winterschmidtiidae) may determine maximum parasitic mite Infestation,"Mutualism is a prominent interaction within ecosystems, yet most may actually be conditional. The symbiotic mite, Ensliniella parasitica Vitzthum, ingests the hemolymph of juvenile potter wasps, Allodynerus delphinalis (Giraud), but also protects them from a natural enemy, Melittobia acasta, and is transported to new nests in host pockets specialized for this purpose (i.e., acarinaria). Thus, two different antagonisms from the mite may arise: commensalistic cheating is expected without the natural enemy of the host, and parasitism is predicted with excessive numbers of the mite. However, facultative parasitism mediated by mutualism has rarely been studied in any organism. We found no significant differences in juvenile mortality, nesting rate, or fecundity between mite-free and naturally mite-laden juveniles. However, when overloaded with mites (1.52.5 times more mites than the maximum number per wasp larva in the field), the developmental period of the male wasp was significantly delayed, and juvenile wasp mortality increased to 30%. These results show that mutualism mediated by parasitism may revert to parasitism, suggesting that either or both organisms in a mutualism mediated by parasitism need population control of the parasite to avoid the risk of parasitism.  2010 Entomological Society of America.",MA70,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Context-dependent interactions of insects and defensive symbionts: insights from a novel system in siricid woodwasps,"Many insect species derive fitness benefits from associations with defensive microbial symbionts that confer protection against pathogens and parasites. These relationships are varied and diverse, but a number of studies highlight important trends. The effects of defensive symbionts can be context-dependent and influenced by variable selection imposed by the organism against which the symbiont protects. Additionally, genetic variation in both hosts and symbionts can greatly influence the outcome of these interactions.

Cooperation and conflict in the evolution of multicellularity,"Multicellular organisms probably originated as groups of cells formed in several ways, including cell proliferation from a group of founder cells and aggregation. Cooperation among cells benefits the group, but may be costly (altruistic) or beneficial (synergistic) to individual cooperating cells. In this paper, we study conflict mediation, the process by which genetic modifiers evolve that enhance cooperation by altering the parameters of development or rules of formation of cell groups. We are particularly interested in the conditions under which these modifiers lead to a new higher-level unit of selection with increased cooperation among group members and heritable variation in fitness at the group level. By sculpting the fitness variation and opportunity for selection at the two levels, conflict modifiers create new functions at the organism level. An organism is more than a group of cooperating cells related by common descent; organisms require adaptations that regulate conflict within. Otherwise their continued evolution is frustrated by the: creation of within-organism variation and conflict between levels of selection. The evolution of conflict modifiers is a necessary prerequisite to the emergence of individuality and the continued well being of the organism. Conflict leads - through the evolution of adaptations that reduce it - to greater individuality and harmony for the organism.",MA78,NM,exclude,,
Cooperation in humans: competition between groups and proximate emotions,"Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that favour cooperation remains one of the greatest challenges in the biological and social sciences. A number of theoretical studies have suggested that competition between groups may have played a key role in the evolution of cooperation within human societies, and similar ideas have been discussed for other organisms, especially cooperative breeding vertebrates. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing these ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans, that when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards, individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and those of their group mates. Overall, our results arc consistent with the idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Cowboy and Indian alliances in the northern plains,"Native Americans and white ranchers/farmers in eastern Montana and western South Dakota have often been in conflict over natural resources, such as water and grazing lands. But in the 1970s, the two groups began to develop a common interest in protecting the rural environment from large-scale development. Since the 1980s, they developed a series of interethnic environmental alliances that successfully opposed coal and uranium mines, bombing ranges, and other ""outside"" threats to their lands and cultures. A common defense of the local place provided a path out of historic natural resources conflicts. Alliances tended to be initiated by traditionalist and activist Native Americans who strongly asserted their tribal identity at the same time as they built bridges to white neighbors around common environmental concerns. This approach simultaneously strengthened a recognition of difference and similarities between Native and non-Native communities. The grassroots alliances promoted a territorially based, multiethnic ""place membership"" to build cooperation across racial lines, rather than state-sponsored ""reconciliation"" programs. Continuing cultural and economic differences made individual alliances difficult to sustain, although the series of alliances progressively improved relations between certain local communities.",MA82,NM,exclude,,
"Crossing scales, crossing disciplines: Collective motion and collective action in the Global Commons","Two conflicting tendencies can be seen throughout the biological world: individuality and collective behaviour. Natural selection operates on differences among individuals, rewarding those who perform better. Nonetheless, even within this milieu, cooperation arises, and the repeated emergence of multicellularity is the most striking example. The same tendencies are played out at higher levels, as individuals cooperate in groups, which compete with other such groups. Many of our environmental and other global problems can be traced to such conflicts, and to the unwillingness of individual agents to take account of the greater good. One of the great challenges in achieving sustainability will be in understanding the basis of cooperation, and in taking multicellularity to yet a higher level, finding the pathways to the level of cooperation that is the only hope for the preservation of the planet.  2010 The Royal Society.",MA83,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical; competition-cooperation
Culture-Free Survey Reveals Diverse and Distinctive Fungal Communities Associated with Developing Figs (Ficus spp.) in Panama,"The ancient association of figs (Ficus spp.) and their pollinating wasps (fig wasps; Chalcidoidea, Hymenoptera) is one of the most interdependent plant-insect mutualisms known. In addition to pollinating wasps, a diverse community of organisms develops within the microcosm of the fig inflorescence and fruit. To better understand the multipartite context of the fig-fig wasp association, we used a culture-free approach to examine fungal communities associated with syconia of six species of Ficus and their pollinating wasps in lowland Panama. Diverse fungi were recovered from surface-sterilized flowers of all Ficus species, including gall- and seed flowers at four developmental stages. Fungal communities in syconia and on pollinating wasps were similar, dominated by diverse and previously unknown Saccharomycotina, and distinct from leaf- and stem endophyte communities in the same region. Before pollination, fungal communities were similar between gall- and seed flowers and among Ficus species. However, fungal communities differed significantly in flowers after pollination vs. before pollination, and between anciently diverged lineages of Ficus with active vs. passive pollination syndromes. Within groups of relatively closely related figs, there was little evidence for strict-sense host specificity between figs and particular fungal species. Instead, mixing of fungal communities among related figs, coupled with evidence for possible transfer by pollinating wasps, is consistent with recent suggestions of pollinator mixing within syconia. In turn, changes in fungal communities during fig development and ripening suggest an unexplored role of yeasts in the context of the fig-pollinator wasp mutualism.",MA85,NM,exclude,,
"Determinants of sperm transfer in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata: male variation, female condition and copulation duration","Recent studies suggest that sperm production and transfer may have significant costs to males. Male sperm investment into a current copulation may therefore influence resources available for future matings, which selects for male strategic mating investment. In addition, females may also benefit from actively or passively altering the number of sperm transferred by males. In the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata, the number of sperm transferred during copulation depended on copulation duration and males in good condition (residual weight) copulated longer and also transferred more sperm. Moreover, sperm transferred and stored per unit time was higher in copulations with females in good condition than in copulations with females in poor condition. Males varied greatly and consistently in their sperm transfer rate, indicative of costs associated with this trait. The duration of the pairing prelude also varied between males and correlated negatively with the male's sperm transfer rate, but no other male character correlated significantly with male sperm transfer rate. The results are consistent with strategic mating effort but sperm transfer could also be facilitated by the physical size of females and/or females in good condition may be more cooperative during sperm transfer.",MA89,NM,exclude,,
Developmental plasticity and social specialization in cooperative societies,"Cooperative breeding systems showcase the diversity of social trajectories within and among species, ranging from the extremes of eusocial insects where individuals become irreversibly specialized as fecund queens or sterile workers, to vertebrate systems where individuals maintain the flexibility to breed throughout life. Between these extremes lies a continuum with individuals exhibiting varying degrees of specialization in their behaviour. Most research on cooperative breeders, particularly on vertebrate systems, has focused on why helping has evolved, rather than addressing this diversity. Here, we present a framework to explain variation in the timing, extent and flexibility of phenotypic divergence across vertebrate and invertebrate cooperative systems. We base our framework on recent theory about how individuals integrate information about the environment from different sources (genes, parents and direct experiences) when establishing their developmental trajectory. We discuss how the timing and degree of divergence and specialization are influenced by the availability and reliability of information about later fitness options and by the extent to which individuals have control over their development. Throughout, we use this developmental perspective to draw broad comparisons across vertebrate and invertebrate systems, which are often considered separately.

Divergent host phenotypes create opportunities and constraints on the distribution of two wing-dwelling feather mites,"The diversity of symbionts (commensals, mutualists or parasites) that share the same host species may depend on opportunities and constraints on host exploitation associated with host phenotype or environment. Various host traits may differently influence host accessibility and within-host population growth of each symbiont species, or they may determine the outcome of within-host interactions among coexisting species. In turn, phenotypic diversity of a host species may promote divergent exploitation strategies among its symbiotic organisms. We studied the distribution of two feather mite species, Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata, among blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla wintering in southern Spain during six winters. The host population included migratory and sedentary individuals, which were unequally distributed between two habitat types (forests and shrublands). Visual mite counts showed that both mite species often coexisted on sedentary blackcaps, but were seldom found together on migratory blackcaps. Regardless of host habitat, Proctophyllodes were highly abundant and Trouessartia were scarce on migratory blackcaps, but the abundance of both mite species converged in intermediate levels on sedentary blackcaps. Coexistence may come at a cost for Proctophyllodes, whose load decreased when Trouessartia was present on the host (the opposite was not true). Proctophyllodes load was positively correlated with host wing length (wings were longer in migratory blackcaps), while Trouessartia load was positively correlated to uropygial gland size (sedentary blackcaps had bigger glands), which might render migratory and sedentary blackcaps better hosts for Proctophyllodes and Trouessartia, respectively. Our results draw a complex scenario for mite co-existence in the same host species, where different mite species apparently take advantage of, or are constrained by, divergent host phenotypic traits. This expands our understanding of bird-mite interactions, which are usually viewed as less dynamic in relation to variation in host phenotype, and emphasizes the role of host phenotypic divergence in the diversification of symbiotic organisms.  2012 The Authors.",MA94,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Diversity within diversity: Parasite species richness in poison frogs assessed by transcriptomics,"Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated. Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology, sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms' diversity. By isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose that endoparasites may escape poison frogs' chemical defenses by colonizing tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored.",MA97,NM,exclude,,
Do seed-dispersing birds exert selection on optimal plant trait combinations? Correlated phenotypic selection on the fruit and seed size of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna),"Seed-dispersing birds can be expected to optimize their energy intake through fruit selection and hence exert a positive selection on fruit pulp content, that is to say, favoring big fruits with small seeds. On the other hand they may select both, average fruit size and its variation. We addressed this issue by analyzing the phenotypic selection exerted by the dispersers of Crataegus monogyna on the fruit and seed size of this species. Fruit and seed size were analyzed at two ontogenic plant stages: the initial size of seeds (and their fruits) as future individuals and the mean size of fruits and seeds produced by adult plants. Fruit diameter and its within-individual variation are the actual targets of selection for maternal fruit traits, negatively affecting relative fitness, although total selection acts only on mean fruit size. For individual seeds, size selection is positive and directed at fruit diameter and seed length, while the remaining traits are subject to indirect selection. Birds exerted a correlational selection favoring big fruits with small seeds. Nevertheless the evolutionary consequences of this selection are expected to be limited by several factors. For example, the positive correlation between fruit and seed sizes, the existence of counteracting selective pressures exerted by other mutualistic or antagonist interactions and temporal or spatial changes in the environmental conditions that may alter the selective forces and even the optimum phenotype in each situation.",MA99,NM,include,interspecific,feeding-foraging; seed dispersal
"Does a competent leader make a good friend? Conflict, ideology and the psychologies of friendship and followership","Research demonstrates that the physical traits of leaders and political candidates influence election outcomes and that subjects favor functionally different physical traits in leaders when their social groups face problems related to war and peace, respectively. Previous research has interpreted these effects as evidence of a problem-sensitive and distinct psychology of followership. In two studies, we extend this research by demonstrating that preferences for physical traits in leaders' faces arise from an integration of both contextual and individual differences related to perceptions of social conflict and that these effects relate only to leader choices. Theoretically, we argue that increased preferences for facial dominance in leaders reflect increased needs for enforced coordinated action when one's group is seen to face threats from other coordinated groups rather than from random natural events. Empirically, we show that preferences for dominant-looking leaders are a function of (1) contextual primes of group-based threats rather than nature-based threats and (2) political ideology (a core measure of perceptions of group-based conflict) such that, across contexts, conservatives prefer dominant-looking leaders more than liberals. For the first time, we demonstrate that the effects of these contextual and individual differences are non-existent when subjects are asked to choose a friend instead of a leader: irrespective of ideology and context, people strongly prefer non-dominant friends. This finding adds significantly to the results of past research and provides evidence of the existence of a distinct psychology of followership that produces leader preferences that are independent of preferences for other social partners.

Does prey mobility affect niche width and individual specialization in hunting wasps? A network-based analysis,"Niche width and inter-individual diet variation in predator populations are known to be affected by intrinsic factors such as body size, age, cognitive constraints, and by intra- and interspecific competition. By contrast, how variation in prey biological traits may affect niche width and partitioning is still a poorly explored topic. One of these candidate traits is prey mobility, which can affect the predators' niche because acting on the rate of encounter and, assuming mobility as a proxy for escape capability, on the success of predator attacks. Here we analysed 20 wasp populations and their prey as individual-based food-webs to test if prey mobility may explain niche width (here defined by the Shannon entropy-based index ) and patterns of inter-individual diet variation (here defined by the interaction-exclusiveness index H2 and the interaction evenness index E2). Niche width was very variable among populations and overall network specialization (H2) was always higher than the expected by null models. In case of high-speed flying prey (e.g. flies, bees), wasps showed wider niches () and lower specialization (H2) than in case of non-flying or slow-flying prey (e.g. spiders, beetles). Evenness (E2), on the other side, did not vary with prey mobility. Altogether, these results suggest that highly elusive prey may lead to wider predators' niche but somehow limit their individual niche specialization.",MA102,NM,exclude,,
Dominance in domestic dogs-A response to Schilder et al. (2014),"We here respond to the claim by Schilder and colleagues (Schilder, M. B. H., Vinke, C. M., van der Borg, J. A. M., 2014. Dominance in domestic dogs revisited: Useful habit and useful construct? J. Vet. Behav.: Clin. App. Res. 9, 184-191) that dominance is a useful construct in the interpretation of companion dog behavior. We first make the distinction between the well-established use of the dominance framework in the ethology of wild species, and its more contentious use in the domestic dog as a character trait and as a descriptor of motivation. By evaluating recent studies of canine ``personality{''} (individual differences in behavior that are consistent across time and context), we conclude that there is no evidence that dominance is a character trait of individual dogs, but rather that it is a property of relationships, that can arise due to asymmetries in any one of at least 3 distinct personality traits. We question whether concepts derived from wolf behavior have much utility in interpreting the behavior of domestic dogs because recent studies of groups of free-ranging dogs confirm that the dog has lost 3 traits key to the social organization of the gray wolf, namely coordinated group hunting, reproductive suppression, and provisioning of cubs by nonreproducing relatives. We further question whether studies of free-ranging dogs, which routinely compete for physical resources, provide an appropriate framework for interpreting the behavior of companion dogs, which generally do not. We then reinterpret Schenkel's ``active submission{''} posture as primarily affiliative and an indicator of the dependence of younger, inexperienced dogs on the older members of their social group. By reviewing the key literature on the cognitive abilities of domestic dogs and other social Carnivora, we demonstrate that the primate-based ``Utrecht School{'' model of dominance makes assumptions that are invalid for domestic dogs, because the overwhelming balance of evidence indicates that relationships among social Carnivora are based on noncognitive mechanisms. We conclude by examining the implications of Schilder and colleagues' model for the management of relationships between dogs and their owners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Dynamics of populations with individual variation in dispersal on bounded domains,"Most classical models for the movement of organisms assume that all individuals have the same patterns and rates of movement (for example, diffusion with a fixed diffusion coefficient) but there is empirical evidence that movement rates and patterns may vary among different individuals. A simple way to capture variation in dispersal that has been suggested in the ecological literature is to allow individuals to switch between two distinct dispersal modes. We study models for populations whose members can switch between two different nonzero rates of diffusion and whose local population dynamics are subject to density dependence of logistic type. The resulting models are reaction-diffusion systems that can be cooperative at some population densities and competitive at others. We assume that the focal population inhabits a bounded region and study how its overall dynamics depend on the parameters describing switching rates and local population dynamics. (Traveling waves and spread rates have been studied for similar models in the context of biological invasions.)

Ecological characteristics of insects that affect symbiotic relationships with mites,"Parasites and pathogens that begin as symbionts, i.e., organisms living together in the same habitat, are some of the most promising drivers of species evolution. Because insects are highly diverse and important as ecosystem service agents and because mites can exert large effects on insect populations (capable of killing at least juveniles), insect-mite interactions have been analyzed from various perspectives, including evolutionary, ecological and pest-management perspectives. Here, I review and examine insect-mite symbiotic associations to develop hypotheses concerning the factors that maintain and develop their relationships. Previous studies have hypothesized that insect sociality and mite richness and specificity affect insect-mite interactions. I found that both solitary and social insects, including parasocial and subsocial insects, harbor numbers of symbionts including species-specific ones but few dangerous mite symbionts in their nests or habitats under natural conditions. Nest size or the amount of food resources in a nest may affect mite richness. On the basis of this review, I hypothesize that the insect characteristics relevant for mite symbiotic hosting are sharing the same habitat with mites and living in a nutrient-rich habitat. I also suggest that many cases of species-specific symbiosis began with phoresy. To test these hypotheses, phylogenetic information on mites living with insect groups and quantitative analysis to characterize each insect-mite relationship are necessary.  2013 The Entomological Society of Japan.",MA110,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Effects of competitive and cooperative interaction among neighboring trees on tree growth in a naturally regenerated even-aged Larix sibirica stand in considering height stratification,"This study attempted to explain the variation in growth of individual trees in a naturally regenerated, even-aged Larix sibirica stand using indices that represented the competitive and cooperative interactions among neighboring trees. These interaction indices and DBH were used in stepwise multiple regression procedures to model the growth of individual trees. However, when the data from all trees were used, DBH was the only factor accepted in the growth model. Since DBH can be influenced by the cumulative effect of past interaction and other environmental factors, we stratified the stand into three height strata and repeated the stepwise procedure for each stratum to remove the cumulative effect represented by DBH. Several competition and/or cooperation indices were accepted in growth models of the lower, middle and upper strata. In each stratum, the residual mean square of the growth model was smaller than that of all strata. These facts suggested that height stratification was generally successful in reducing the cumulative effect of past interaction and other factors. The cooperation indices that suggested protection from wind stress by neighboring trees was a significant variable in the growth models of all three strata. This demonstrated that cooperative interaction should be considered in the explanation of variation in tree growth in dry and windy climates such as the present study region.",MA114,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; plants
"Elephants, donuts and hamburgers: Young children co-operating to co-operate and co-operating to compete in two primary schools","Abstract A total of 152 5-6-year-old schoolchildren worked alone or in groups, cooperatively within groups or competing against another group, over 4 weeks. New measures allowed us to consider their preferences for collective or individualistic styles. Three factors: individualism/collectivism, sociability and altruism were identified. The first two were found to be stable over time; the third changed and was related to whether the children worked co-operatively or competitively. Differences were found in collectivism/individualism. Girls (particularly older girls) preferred working co-operatively significantly more than boys at Time 1; however, this decreased over time for girls, whilst boys became less individualistic over time. Younger children scored significantly less than older children on a sociability factor, but this increased significantly over time compared to the older children--artificially in the group co-operative condition.

Emergence of ratio-dependent and predator-dependent functional responses for pollination mutualism and seed parasitism,"Prey (N) dependence {[}g(N)], predator (P) dependence {[}g(P) or g(N,P)], and ratio dependence {[}f(P/N)] are often seen as contrasting forms of the predator's functional response describing predator consumption rates on prey resources in predator-prey and parasitoid-host interactions. Analogously, prey-, predator-, and ratio-dependent functional responses are apparently alternative functional responses for other types of consumer-resource interactions. These include, for example, the fraction of flowers pollinated or seeds parasitized in pollination (pre-dispersal) seed-parasitism mutualisms, such as those between fig wasps and fig trees or yucca moths and yucca plants. Here we examine the appropriate functional responses for how the fraction of flowers pollinated and seeds parasitized vary with the density of pollinators (predator dependence) or the ratio of pollinator and flower densities (ratio dependence). We show that both types of functional responses can emerge from minor, but biologically important variations on a single model. An individual-based model was first used to describe plant-pollinator interactions. Conditional upon on whether the number of flowers visited by the pollinator was limited by factors other than search time (e.g., by the number of eggs it had to lay, if it was also a seed parasite), and on whether the pollinator could directly find flowers on a plant, or had to search, the simulation results lead to either a predator-dependent or a ratio-dependent functional response. An analytic model was then used to show mathematically how these two cases can arise.

Endocrinology of sociality: Comparisons between sociable and solitary individuals within the same population of African striped mice,"The social organization of species ranges from solitary-living to complex social groups. While the evolutionary reasons of group-living are well studied, the physiological mechanisms underlying alternative social systems are poorly understood. By studying group-living and solitary individuals of the same species, we can determine hormonal correlates of sociality without the problem of confounding phylogenetic factors. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) is a socially flexible species, which can be solitary or alternatively form complex family groups, depending on population density and the extent of reproductive competition. We predicted group-living striped mice to show signs of reproductive suppression and social stress, resulting in higher corticosterone but lower testosterone levels when compared to solitary-living individuals. To determine whether differences in social organization correlated with hormonal differences, we collected blood samples from free-living striped mice during four breeding seasons when we experimentally induced solitary-living in philopatric individuals by locally reducing population density. Striped mice that were group-living did not change their corticosterone or estosterone levels during the study, indicating that there was no temporal effect during the breeding season. Striped mice of both sexes had significantly lower corticosterone levels after switching from group- to solitary-living. Solitary males - but not solitary females - had higher testosterone levels than group-living conspecifics. Our results suggest that group-living results in physiological stress and can induce reproductive suppression, at least in philopatric males. The switch to solitary-living may thus be a tactic to avoid reproductive competition within groups, and is associated with decreased stress hormone levels and onset of independent reproduction.

Evolution Of Helping And Harming In Heterogeneous Groups,"Social groups are often composed of individuals who differ in many respects. Theoretical studies on the evolution of helping and harming behaviors have largely focused upon genetic differences between individuals. However, nongenetic variation between group members is widespread in natural populations, and may mediate differences in individuals' social behavior. Here, we develop a framework to study how variation in individual quality mediates the evolution of unconditional and conditional social traits. We investigate the scope for the evolution of social traits that are conditional on the quality of the actor and/or recipients. We find that asymmetries in individual quality can lead to the evolution of plastic traits with different individuals expressing helping and harming traits within the same group. In this context, population viscosity can mediate the evolution of social traits, and local competition can promote both helping and harming behaviors. Furthermore, asymmetries in individual quality can lead to the evolution of competition-like traits between clonal individuals. Overall, we highlight the importance of asymmetries in individual quality, including differences in reproductive value and the ability to engage in successful social interactions, in mediating the evolution of helping and harming behaviors  2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",MA127,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social hierarchies/networks
Evolution of the individual,"This article studies the transition in evolution from single cells to multicellular organisms as a case study in the origin of individuality. The issues considered are applicable to all major transitions in the units of selection that involve the emergence of cooperation and the regulation of conflict. Explicit genetic models of mutation and selection both within and between organisms are studied. Cooperation among cells increases when the fitness covariance at the level of the organism overcomes within-organism change toward defection. Selection and mutation during development generate significant levels of within-organism variation and lead to variation in organism fitness at equilibrium. This variation selects for germ-line modifiers and other mediators of within-organism conflict, increasing the heritability of fitness at the organism level. The evolution of these modifiers is the first new function at the emerging organism level and a necessary component of the evolution of individuality.",MA129,NM,exclude,,
"Evolution, adaptation, and host selection by plant viruses: Current understanding and future perspectives","Plant viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities. They are infectious agents with small genome sizes and require living host cells to complete their life cycles. So far, the origin and evolution of plant viruses is mystery, but several experimental and molecular evidences indicate that plant viruses have been evolved as a result of symbiogenesis or through competition. Different selection pressures in different hosts will result in fitness trade-offs across hosts, leading to specialization. Newly emerged viruses have their origin in host species or populations in which they are well established and their emergence get influenced by various factors viz. alternation in the host plant and/or virus ecology, changes in genetic composition of the host and virus population, and in the case of vectored viruses, changes in the ecology or genetic composition of the vector. Like other living entities, viruses substantially resemble the parent during their replication, but can change to give rise to new type strains. This inherent variation enables viruses to adapt to new and changing situations. However, the complete picture of virus-virus and virus-host interactions is much more complex, since the viral populations constantly evolves and adapt to their new hosts and vectors and ultimately affects ecosystem dynamics. Considering these points, this chapter provides deep insights into the current understanding and future perspectives of evolution, adaptation, and host selection by plant viruses.  2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",MA131,NM,exclude,,
Experimental demonstration of no effect by the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus (Cuvier and Valenciennes) on the host fish Pomacentrus moluccensis (Bleeker),"To date, the benefits of cleaner fish to host fish have not been clearly identified. This study investigates the effect of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus (Cuvier and Valenciennes) on the host damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis (Bleeker) by excluding all cleaner fish from 8 reefs for 6 months at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. The subsequent effect of cleaner removal on parasites (total number, number per category of parasite, and size of parasite) and host abundance was estimated and compared to control reefs where L. dimidiatus were not removed. Parasite loads of P. moluccensis were low (usually 0-3 per fish) on all reefs after the experiment, and were dominated by small copepod larvae (260-1370 mu m). The removal of L. dimidiatus had no detectable effect on the mean number of parasites per host, either across all parasite taxa combined or by each parasite taxon individually. Nor did I detect a difference in the mean size of the most abundant copepod species. There was, however, a significant difference in the mean number of parasites (combining all species) per fish among reefs irrespective of the presence of L. dimidiatus. This difference was not correlated with P. moluccensis abundance. The abundance of P. moluccensis declined during the experiment (7-33\%) but the decline did not differ among reefs with and without L. dimidiatus. This result suggests that P. moluccensis did not leave reefs and seek cleaning elsewhere, nor did this host suffer increased mortality in the absence of L. dimidiatus. The absence of any detectable effect of L. dimidiatus on the parasites of P. moluccensis is compatible with the selective feeding habits of L. dimidiatus. It is likely that factors other than ectoparasite removal motivate P. moluccensis to seek cleaning.",MA134,NM,exclude,,
Experimental evolution of multicellularity using microbial pseudo-organisms,"In a major evolutionary transition to a new level of organization, internal conflicts must be controlled before the transition can truly be successful. One such transition is that from single cells to multicellularity. Conflicts among cells in multicellular organisms can be greatly reduced if they consist of genetically identical clones. However, mutations to cheaters that experience one round of within-individual selection could still be a problem, particularly for certain life cycles. We propose an experimental evolution method to investigate this issue, using micro-organisms to construct multicellular pseudo-organisms, which can be evolved under different artificial life cycles. These experiments can be used to test the importance of various life cycle features in maintaining cooperation. They include structured reproduction, in which small propagule size reduces within-individual genetic variation. They also include structured growth, which increases local relatedness within individual bodies. Our method provides a novel way to test how different life cycles favour cooperation, even for life cycles that do not exist.  2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Exploration is dependent on reproductive state, not social state, in a cooperatively breeding bird","Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for development after a change in social status. In the facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers, suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However, novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism for generating individual differences in behavior.",MA136,NM,exclude,,
Facial identity and emotional expression as predictors during economic decisions,"Two sources of information most relevant to guide social decision making are the cooperative tendencies associated with different people and their facial emotional displays. This electrophysiological experiment aimed to study how the use of personal identity and emotional expressions as cues impacts different stages of face processing and their potential isolated or interactive processing. Participants played a modified trust game with 8 different alleged partners, and in separate blocks either the identity or the emotions carried information regarding potential trial outcomes (win or loss). Behaviorally, participants were faster to make decisions based on identity compared to emotional expressions. Also, ignored (nonpredictive) emotions interfered with decisions based on identity in trials where these sources of information conflicted. Electrophysiological results showed that expectations based on emotions modulated processing earlier in time than those based on identity. Whereas emotion modulated the central N1 and VPP potentials, identity judgments heightened the amplitude of the N2 and P3b. In addition, the conflict that ignored emotions generated was reflected on the N170 and P3b potentials. Overall, our results indicate that using identity or emotional cues to predict cooperation tendencies recruits dissociable neural circuits from an early point in time, and that both sources of information generate early and late interactive patterns.",MA137,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; human behaviour
Facultative sex ratio adjustment by western bluebird mothers with stay-at-home helpers-at-the-nest,"Although population sex ratios rarely deviate from unity, the sex ratio of individual mothers should be labile, allowing them to bias their sex ratios in favour of the more successful sex when they can expect a difference in the mean reproductive value of their daughters and sons. just how mothers should bias sex allocation is particularly complicated in cooperative breeders, because the adaptive sex ratio may be influenced by conflicting impacts of helpers on their parents' fitness via `local resource enhancement' and `local resource competition'. In western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, breeding-age helpers-at-the-nest are exclusively male and increase their parents' nesting success in the current year. As such, they are viewed as helpers, not hinderers, even though by failing to gain a breeding position they reduce their parents' annual inclusive fitness below that of parents with a breeding son. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that nonbreeding, stay-at-home helpers indicate poor breeding prospects for locally competing sons, and investigated one prediction of this hypothesis that such helpers also indicate a tendency for parents to produce substandard sons. A female removal experiment showed that female mates were in short supply. Pairs had daughter-biased broods when they had a stay-at-home helper son that failed to get a mate in the first place, but not when they had a helper that had been breeding on his own, but returned home to help sometime after his mother finished laying her eggs. Stay-at-home sons were not developmentally delayed relative to breeders of the same cohort, suggesting that helpers may not be inferior to breeders. Although the population sex ratio fluctuates about unity, a multiyear data set showed a negative relationship between the frequency of helping and the annual brood sex ratio for the population. These results suggest that local resource competition outweighs local resource enhancement in driving individual and population sex ratio variation in western bluebirds, a pattern that would not be predicted based on the simple question of whether helpers help or hinder at the nest.

Favouritism or intrabrood competition? Access to food and the benefits of philopatry for red-cockaded woodpeckers,"In species showing delayed natal dispersal, broodmates vary in natal dispersal timing and strategy, where some choose to disperse early while others delay. In the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, typically only one juvenile male per brood delays dispersal despite the lifetime fitness benefits associated with delayed dispersal. We sought to determine whether adult favouritism or intrabrood competition over the distribution of natal food resources provides a mechanism for the persistence of individual variation in natal dispersal strategies. We show that fledgling red-cockaded woodpeckers form male-biased, linear dominance hierarchies as a result of frequent aggressive conflicts. For males, high nestling condition relative to male broodmates was a strong predictor of future dominance, and this condition-rank relationship persisted after individuals reached nutritional independence. Adults were never observed interfering with broodmate conflicts, and were only rarely aggressive towards fledglings. Adults showed no overt favouritism towards offspring when targeting individual fledglings during provisioning early in the postfledging period. However, conflict rates increased with decreasing targeted-feeding rates, suggesting that access to resources is an important function of dominance hierarchies. After fledglings were developmentally able to compete for positions near foraging adults, first-and second-ranking males were fed more often than subordinate females. Of the juvenile males surviving to spring, subordinates were more likely to disperse during their first year than were their dominant broodmates. Together, our findings suggest that for young red-cockaded woodpeckers, intrabrood social rank provides a mechanism for prioritized access to natal resources and variation in natal dispersal strategy.

Feather mite abundance varies but symbiotic nature of mite-host relationship does not differ between two ecologically dissimilar warblers,"Feather mites are obligatory ectosymbionts of birds that primarily feed on the oily secretions from the uropygial gland. Feather mite abundance varies within and among host species and has various effects on host condition and fitness, but there is little consensus on factors that drive variation of this symbiotic system. We tested hypotheses regarding how within-species and among-species traits explain variation in both (1) mite abundance and (2) relationships between mite abundance and host body condition and components of host fitness (reproductive performance and apparent annual survival). We focused on two closely related (Parulidae), but ecologically distinct, species: Setophaga cerulea (Cerulean Warbler), a canopy dwelling open-cup nester, and Protonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler), an understory dwelling, cavity nester. We predicted that feather mites would be more abundant on and have a more parasitic relationship with P.citrea, and within P.citrea, females and older individuals would harbor greater mite abundances. We captured, took body measurements, quantified feather mite abundance on individuals primaries and rectrices, and monitored individuals and their nests to estimate fitness. Feather mite abundance differed by species, but in the opposite direction of our prediction. There was no relationship between mite abundance and any measure of body condition or fitness for either species or sex (also contrary to our predictions). Our results suggest that species biology and ecological context may influence mite abundance on hosts. However, this pattern does not extend to differential effects of mites on measures of host body condition or fitness.  2017 The Authors.

Forest pathogens: Friend or foe to biodiversity?,"Biological diversity in forest ecosystems results from evolutionary processes driven by ecological imperatives linked to pathogens, symbionts, fire, climate, and competition or impacts from other agents of disturbance. To understand the behavior of microorganisms and microbial pathogens, it is necessary to have a comprehensive appreciation for the diversity of their functional attributes in their natural habitats. Where niches are complex, evolution is guided by more than simple host-pathogen relationships. Moreover, the negative attributes of a pathosystem are not always obvious at different scales or in different contexts. Deleterious impacts on one species (e.g., mortality, parasitism) may benefit another species through reduced competition or enhanced nutrient cycling. Species with pathogenic behavior also display mutualistic and symbiotic benefits (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi and endophytic antagonists found in grasses) or useful attributes as biological control agents. Preserving the diversity of natural areas while controlling forest pests is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to understand pest niches more thoroughly, while the opportunity is to have a wiser use of both timber and nontimber forest resources.",MA154,NM,exclude,,
From pattern to process: Species and functional diversity in fungal endophytes of Abies beshanzuensis,"The biodiversity-functional relationship in fungal ecology was recently developed and debated, but has rarely been addressed in endophytes. In this study, an integrative culture system was designed to capture a rich fungal consortium from the conifer Abies beshanzuensis. Results indicate an impressive diversity of fungal lineages (a total of 84 taxa classified in Dikarya) and a relatively high proportion of hitherto unknown species (27.4. %). The laccase gene was used as a functional marker due to its involvement in lignocellulose degradation. Remarkable diversity of laccase genes was found across a wide range of taxa, with at least 35 and 19 distinct sequences in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes respectively, were revealed. Many groups displayed variable ability to decompose needles. Furthermore, many ascomycetes, including three volatile-producing Muscodor species (Xylariaceae), showed the ability to inhibit pathogens. Notably, most laccase-producing species showed little or no antibiosis and vice versa. Clavicipitalean and ustilaginomycetous fungi, specifically toxic to insects, were inferred from taxonomic information. Intra-specific physiological variation in Pezicula sporulosa, a second dominant species, was clearly high. We conclude that a suite of defensive characteristics in endophytes contributes to improving host fitness under various stresses and that a diversity of laccase genes confers an ecological advantage in competition for nutrients. Intra-specific diversity may be of great ecological significance for ecotypic adaptation. These findings suggest a fair degree of functional complementarity rather than redundancy among endemic symbionts of natural plant populations.  2010 The British Mycological Society.",MA157,NM,exclude,,
Functional consequences of plant-animal interactions along the mutualism-antagonism gradient,"Plant-animal interactions are pivotal for ecosystem functioning, and usually form complex networks involving multiple species of mutualists as well as antagonists. The costs and benefits of these interactions show a strong context-dependency directly related to individual variation in partner identity and differential strength. Yet understanding the context-dependency and functional consequences of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions on individuals remains a lasting challenge. We use a network approach to characterize the individual, plant-based pollination interaction networks of the Canarian Isoplexis canariensis (Plantaginaceae) with a mixed assemblage of vertebrate mutualists (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and predispersal seed predators). We identify and quantify interaction typologies based on the sign (mutualistic vs. antagonistic) and strength (weak vs. strong) of animal-mediated pollination and test the relationship with individual female reproductive success (FRS). In addition, we document pollinator movement patterns among individual plants to infer events of pollen transfer/receipt that define the plant mating networks and test the relationship with FRS. We identify six interaction typologies along a mutualism-antagonism gradient, with two typologies being over-represented involving both mutualists and antagonists and influencing FRS. Plants showing strong mutualistic interactions, but also (weak or strong) interactions with antagonists are relatively better connected in the mating network (i.e., with higher potential to transfer or receive pollen). Thus, mixed flower visitor assemblages with mutualists and antagonists give plants increased their importance in the mating networks, promote outcrossing and increasing both female and male fitness. Our approach helps characterize plant-animal interaction typologies, the context-specificity of diversified mutualisms, and a better forecasting of their functional consequences.  2017 by the Ecological Society of America",MA160,NM,include,interspecific,theoretical/modelling; plant-animal
Genetic and genomic evidence of niche partitioning and adaptive radiation in mountain pine beetle fungal symbionts,"Bark beetles form multipartite symbiotic associations with blue stain fungi (Ophiostomatales, Ascomycota). These fungal symbionts play an important role during the beetle's life cycle by providing nutritional supplementation, overcoming tree defences and modifying host tissues to favour brood development. The maintenance of stable multipartite symbioses with seemingly less competitive symbionts in similar habitats is of fundamental interest to ecology and evolution. We tested the hypothesis that the coexistence of three fungal species associated with the mountain pine beetle is the result of niche partitioning and adaptive radiation using SNP genotyping coupled with genotype-environment association analysis and phenotypic characterization of growth rate under different temperatures. We found that genetic variation and population structure within each species is best explained by distinct spatial and environmental variables. We observed both common (temperature seasonality and the host species) and distinct (drought, cold stress, precipitation) environmental and spatial factors that shaped the genomes of these fungi resulting in contrasting outcomes. Phenotypic intraspecific variations in Grosmannia clavigera and Leptographium longiclavatum, together with high heritability, suggest potential for adaptive selection in these species. By contrast, Ophiostoma montium displayed narrower intraspecific variation but greater tolerance to extreme high temperatures. Our study highlights unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in these symbionts that are consistent with our hypothesis. By maintaining this multipartite relationship, the bark beetles have a greater likelihood of obtaining the benefits afforded by the fungi and reduce the risk of being left aposymbiotic. Complementarity among species could facilitate colonization of new habitats and survival under adverse conditions.",MA163,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Good Daphnia parents do not control the offspring microbiome,"In Focus: Mushegian, A. A., Walser, J. -C., Sullam, K. E., & Ebert, D. (2018). The microbiota of diapause: How hostmicrobe associations are formed after dormancy in an aquatic crustacean. Journal of Animal Ecology, 87, 400413. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12709. All animals are colonized by micro-organisms, most of which are benign or beneficial. Where do these micro-organisms come from? Theory predicts that micro-organisms which are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring are especially likely to be beneficial to the host, while horizontally acquired micro-organisms are opportunistic and more variable in their impact on host performance. In this issue, Mushegian etal. () investigate the source of bacteria that are required for the growth and development of Daphnia water fleas to reproductive adults. They find that, although vertically transmitted bacteria can occur in the capsule enclosing the Daphnia eggs, the micro-organisms that promote Daphnia performance are associated with the external surface of the capsule and are of likely environmental origin. This mode of transmission may be adaptive for Daphnia because, linked to the longevity and capacity for long-distance dispersal of these eggs, the environmental circumstances encountered by parent and offspring may be different; with the implication, the parental micro-organisms may not be optimal for the offspring. This study demonstrates that, although some animals require symbioses with specific coevolved, vertically transmitted microbial symbionts, other animals have evolved dependence on taxonomically variable micro-organisms of environmental origin.  2018 The Author.

Harsh childhood environmental characteristics predict exploitation and retaliation in humans,"Across andwithin societies,people vary intheirpropensities towards exploitative and retaliatory defection in potentially cooperative interaction.We hypothesized that this variation reflects adaptive responses to variation in cues during childhood that life will be harsh, unstable and short-cues that probabilistically indicate that it is in one's fitness interests to exploit co-operators and to retaliate quickly against defectors. Here, we show that childhood exposure to family neglect, conflict and violence, and to neighbourhood crime, were positively associated for men (but not women) with exploitation of an interaction partner and retaliatory defection after that partner began to defect. The associations between childhood environment and both forms of defection for men appeared to be mediated by participants' endorsement of a 'code of honour'. These results suggest that individual differences in mutual benefit cooperation are not merely due to genetic noise, random developmental variation or the operation of domain-general cultural learning mechanisms, but rather, might reflect the adaptive calibration of social strategies to local social-ecological conditions.  2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Heritable variation in prey defence provides refuge for subdominant predators,"Generalist predators with broadly overlapping niches commonly coexist on seemingly identical sets of prey. Here, we provide empirical demonstration that predators can differentially exploit fine-grained niches generated by variable, heritable and selective defences within a single prey species. Some, but not all, clones of the aphid Aphis craccivora are toxic towards the dominant invasive predatory ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis. However, other less competitive ladybeetle species are not affected by the aphid's toxic trait. In laboratory and open field experiments, we show: (i) that subdominant ladybeetle species were able to exploit the toxic aphids, benefitting from the suppression of the dominant predator; and (ii) that this narrow-spectrum toxicity can function as an anti-predator defence for the aphid, but depends on enemy community context. Our results demonstrate that niche differentiation among generalist predators may hinge upon previously underappreciated heritable variation in prey defence, which, in turn, may promote diversity and stability of enemy communities invaded by a dominant predator.",MA175,NM,include,intraspecific,predator-prey; predator defence behaviour
Hormonal underpinnings of status conflict: Testosterone and cortisol are related to decisions and satisfaction in the hawk-dove game,"A contribution to a special issue on Hormones and Human Competition. Testosterone is theorized to influence status-seeking behaviors such as social dominance and competitive behavior, but supporting evidence is mixed. The present study tested the roles of testosterone and cortisol in the hawk dove game, a dyadic economic decision-making paradigm in which earnings depend on one's own and the other player's choices. If one person selects the hawk strategy and the other person selects the dove strategy, the player who selected hawk attains a greater financial pay-off (status differentiation). The worst financial outcome occurs when both players choose the hawk strategy (status confrontation). Ninety-eight undergraduate students (42 men) provided saliva samples and played ten rounds of the hawk-dove game with another same-sex participant. In support of the hypothesis that testosterone is related to status concern, individuals higher in basal testosterone made more hawk decisions decisions that harmed the other player. Acute decreases in cortisol were also associated with more hawk decisions. There was some empirical support for the dual-hormone hypothesis as well: basal testosterone was positively related to satisfaction in the game among low basal-cortisol individuals but not among high basal-cortisol individuals. There were no significant sex differences in these hormonal effects. The present findings align with theories of hormones and status-seeking behavior at the individual level, but they also open up new avenues for research on hormone profiles at the collective level. Our results suggest that the presence of two or more high-testosterone members increases the likelihood of status confrontations over a limited resource that can undermine collective outcomes.

Host-pathogen interaction as a special case of interrelations between organisms,"Plants are open systems and therefore maintain a vast number of complex relationships with the environment. Among these are: 1. Dependencies upon the external environment. 2. Strong influences on the environment. 3. Diverse interrelations with other organisms at different levels, of plant species among each other, and of plants with animals including human beings. According to the nature of the interaction various types of interrelations can be distinguished: (a) neutral relations (e.g. epiphytes), (b) mutualistic relations (fertilization, symbiosis), and (c) parasitic relations (incompatibility, the phytopathological host-parasite interactions). Pathogens can be defined as organisms out of place. As a result of special conditions defense reactions are observed in the stricken individuals such as irregular reactions on the metabolic level, formation of phytoalexins, competition for food, space, etc., involving also genetic interrelationships between hosts and their parasites. Such interrelations occurring on the cellular level include the problems of cell recognition, adherence of the cell surfaces to each other, and intercellular bridging. Interactions on the individual population and ecosystem levels can be reduced to aspects of the interactions, which involve mutual gene regulation.  1968 Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.",MA184,NM,include,interspecific,theory; parasite-host
Hotspots of damage by antagonists shape the spatial structure of plant-pollinator interactions,"The balance between mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions and their spatial variation results in a highly dynamic mosaic of reproductive success within plant populations. Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",MA187,NM,include,interspecific,plant-animal interaction; pollinator-host
Improvement of identification methods for honeybee specific Lactic Acid Bacteria; Future approaches,"Honeybees face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. The crop microbiota of Apis mellifera, composed of 13 Lactic Acid Bacterial (LAB) species within the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, form a beneficial symbiotic relationship with each other and the honeybee to protect their niche and their host. Possibly playing a vital role in honeybee health, it is important that these honeybee specific Lactic Acid Bacterial (hbs-LAB) symbionts can be correctly identified, isolated and cultured, to further investigate their health promoting properties. We have previously reported successful identification to the strain level by culturedependent methods and we recently sequenced and annotated the genomes of the 13 hbs- LAB. However, the hitherto applied techniques are unfortunately very time consuming, expensive and not ideal when analyzing a vast quantity of samples. In addition, other researchers have constantly failed to identify the 13 hbs-LAB from honeybee samples by using inadequate media and/or molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing with insufficient discriminatory power. The aim of this study was to develop better and more suitable methods for the identification and cultivation of hbs-LAB. We compared currently used bacterial cultivation media and could for the first time demonstrate a significant variation in the hbs-LAB basic requirements for optimal growth. We also present a new bacterial identification approach based on amplicon sequencing of a region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina platform and an error correction software that can be used to successfully differentiate and rapidly identify the 13 hbs-LAB to the strain level.  2017 Lamei et al.

"Incidence and biomarkers of pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal loss during an environmental stressor: Implications for female reproductive suppression in the cooperatively breeding meerkat","Meerkats are group-living, insectivorous herpestids in which subordinate members provide extensive care for the dominant female's young. In contrast to some cooperative breeders, subordinate female meerkats are physiologically able to reproduce and occasionally do so successfully; their attempts are more frequently `suppressed' via eviction or infanticide by the dominant female. Spontaneous abortion and neonatal loss occur with some regularity, further negatively impacting reproductive success. Here, we compared the reproductive outcomes and endocrine profiles, including of serum progesterone (P-4), serum estradiol (E-2), and fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCm), of dominant and subordinate dams residing within their clans in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Our study spanned years of drought, which reduced insect abundance and represented a substantial environmental stressor. Meerkat pregnancies were identified at mid-term and culminated either in spontaneous abortions or full-term deliveries, after which pups were either lost prior to emergence from the natal den (usually within 2 days of birth) or emerged at 2-3 weeks. Neonatal loss exceeded fetal loss for all females, and contributed to narrowing the status-related disparity in female reproductive output seen during less arid periods. Although E-2 concentrations were significantly lower in subordinate than dominant females, they were sufficient to support gestation. Absolute E-2 concentrations may owe to androgenic precursors that also attain highest concentrations in dominant dams and may mediate aggression underlying female reproductive skew. Pregnancies terminating in fetal loss were marked by significantly lower 134 concentrations in mid-gestation and modestly lower E-2 concentrations overall. Consistently high fGCm concentrations further increased across trimesters, particularly (but not consistently) in subordinates and in aborted pregnancies. Environmental stressor may modulate reproductive outcomes in meerkats through their influence on sex steroids and their effects on intragroup competition. The social and eco-physiological factors affecting intraspecific variation in reproductive output, even in obligate cooperative breeders, may be most apparent during extreme conditions, reflecting the benefits of long-term studies for assessing the impact of climate change.",MA193,NM,exclude,,
"Inclusive fitness, asymmetric competition and kin selection in plants","The findings that some plants alter their competitive phenotype in response to genetic relatedness of its conspecific neighbour (and presumed competitor) has spurred an increasing interest in plant kin-interactions. This phenotypic response suggests the ability to assess the genetic relatedness of conspecific competitors, proposing kin selection as a process that can influence plant competitive interactions. Kin selection can favour restrained competitive growth towards kin, if the fitness loss from reducing own growth is compensated by increased fitness in the related neighbour. This may lead to positive frequency dependency among related conspecifics with important ecological consequences for species assemblage and coexistence. However, kin selection in plants is still controversial. First, many studies documenting a plastic response to neighbour relatedness do not estimate fitness consequences of the individual that responds, and when estimated, fitness of individuals grown in competition with kin did not necessarily exceed that of individuals grown in non-kin groups. Although higher fitness in kin groups could be consistent with kin selection, this could also arise from mechanisms like asymmetric competition in the non-kin groups. Here we outline the main challenges for studying kin selection in plants taking genetic variation for competitive ability into account. We emphasize the need to measure inclusive fitness in order to assess whether kin selection occurs, and show under which circumstances kin selected responses can be expected. We also illustrate why direct fitness estimates of a focal plant, and group fitness estimates are not suitable for documenting kin selection. Importantly, natural selection occurs at the individual level and it is the inclusive fitness of an individual plant - not the mean fitness of the group - that can capture if a differential response to neighbour relatedness is favoured by kin selection.",MA194,NM,include,intraspecific,plant-plant interactions
Independent origins of parasitism in Animalia,"Nearly half of all animals may have a parasitic lifestyle, yet the number of transitions to parasitism and their potential for species diversification remain unresolved. Based on a comprehensive survey of the animal kingdom, we find that parasitism has independently evolved at least 223 times in just 15 phyla, with the majority of identified independent parasitic groups occurring in the Arthropoda, at or below the level of Family. Metazoan parasitology is dominated by the study of helminthes; however, only 20% of independently derived parasite taxa belong to those groups, with numerous transitions also seen in Mollusca, Rotifera, Annelida and Cnidaria. Parasitism is almost entirely absent from deuterostomes, and although worm-like morphology and host associations are widespread across Animalia, the dual symbiotic and trophic interactions required for parasitism may constrain its evolution from antecedent consumer strategies such as generalist predators and filter feeders. In general, parasitic groups do not differ from their free-living relatives in their potential for speciation. However, the 10 largest parasitic clades contain 90% of described parasitic species, or perhaps 40% of all animal species. Hence, a substantial fraction of animal diversity on the Earth arose following these few transitions to a parasitic trophic strategy.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Individual and genetic task specialization in policing behaviour in the European honeybee,"Cooperation in biological systems is frequently maintained by social enforcement mechanisms, where individually egoistic and group-costly behaviour is mutually suppressed by other group members. One of the best examples in nature is worker policing in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, where workers selectively remove or police eggs laid by workers that egoistically try to produce their own offspring instead of working for the good of the colony. It has long been suggested that worker policing behaviour should be genetically determined, as theory has shown that queen polyandry in the honeybee would be expected to give rise to clear indirect genetic or inclusive fitness benefits of worker policing, thereby causing genes for policing to spread in the population. In the present study, we tested the theory that worker policing should have a genetic component by determining whether workers belonging to different patrilines, derived from different fathers, differ in their tendency to police eggs. This analysis showed that variation in policing behaviour indeed has a genetic basis, with the trait having an estimated broad-sense heritability of 0.25 ([0.0130.46] 95% confidence limits). In addition, there was clear individual specialization in policing, as just a few individuals within each patriline were observed to police. Remarkably though, there was no evidence for age specialization, as workers of all ages, except those younger than 10 days and older than ca. 40 days, engaged in policing. This contrasts with most other behaviours in the honeybee, which usually follow a strict age-linked pattern of division of labour. Overall, we conclude that worker policing behaviour in the honeybee is genetically heritable and that workers of all ages engage in policing to help maintain the social order in the colony.  2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",MA197,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; social networks
Individual variation behind the evolution of cooperation,"Life on Earth has two remarkable properties. The first is variation: even apart from the vast number of extant species, there are considerable differences between individuals within a single species. The second property is cooperation. It is surprising that until recently the interactions between these two properties have rarely been addressed from an evolutionary point of view. Here, I concentrate on how inter-individual differences influence the evolution of cooperation. First, I deal with cases where individuality is maintained by random processes like mutation or phenotypic noise. Second, I examine when differences in state cause differences in behaviour. Finally, I investigate the effects of individual role specialization. Variation can be important in several ways. Increased random variation can change the expectation about cooperativeness of future partners, altering behaviour in a current relationship. Differences in state may serve as a book-keeping mechanism that is necessary for the evolution of reciprocity. If the cost of cooperation can depend on state then strategic regulation of state makes it possible to coerce partners to cooperate. If conditions force individuals to specialize, cooperation becomes more valuable. My review of theoretical models suggests that variation plays an important role in the evolution of cooperation.",MA201,NM,include,intraspecific,theory; competition-cooperation;
Inducible defence and the social evolution of herd immunity,"Many organisms vary their level of investment in defensive characters. Protective traits may be induced upon exposure to predators or parasites. In a similar way, humans vaccinate in response to threatening epidemics. When most group members defend themselves, epidemics die out quickly because parasites cannot spread. A high level of group (herd) immunity is therefore beneficial to the group. There is, however, a well-known divergence between the optimum degree of induction for selfish individuals and the level of induction that maximizes group benefit. I develop two optimality models for the frequency of induction. The first model shows that higher relatedness favours more induction and a smaller difference between selfish and cooperative optima. The second model assumes variation in the vigour of individuals and therefore differences in the relative cost for induction. The model predicts that strong individuals induce more easily than weak individuals. Small differences in vigour cause a large divergence in the optimal levels of induction for strong and weak individuals. The concept of genetic relatedness in an evolutionary model is analogous to correlated interests and correlated strategies in an economic model of human behaviour. The evolutionary models presented here therefore provide a basis for further study of human vaccination.",MA204,NM,include,intraspecific,theory/modelling; competition-cooperation;
Insect-flower interactions: network structure in organic versus conventional vineyards,"Ecosystems are made up of various mutualistic and antagonistic plant and animal interactions. These interactions are subject to various global change phenomena such as land use change and habitat modification. While the effect of environmentally friendly farming practices on the taxonomic diversity of plants and animal species has been reported, it is uncertain whether these schemes provide benefit for species interaction networks. We compared insect-flower interaction networks by analyzing important web structure indices from organic and conventional vineyards and natural vegetation sites in five different localities in the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot. Average number of insect-flower interactions was higher in organic vineyards compared with conventional vineyards and natural sites. Abundance of flowering plants contributed significantly to explain the observed difference in number of interactions in the model. Other network indices were similar between the different land use types. Our results support the importance of less intensive farming for promoting biodiversity. Approaches such as organic farming are especially beneficial for important interaction networks that drive the process of maintaining biodiversity. The potential of well-managed vineyard ecosystems for promoting conservation of ecologically important insect-flower interactions is demonstrated.",MA207,NM,exclude,,
Inspection behaviour and inter-individual cooperation in juvenile qingbo: the effects of prior predator exposure and food deprivation,"The predation pressure and food availability to which individuals are exposed during their life histories shape inspection behaviour in animals. In this study, we aimed to test whether such behaviours varied with prior experience (predation, starvation or both treatments) or measurement condition (with or without the presence of a predator; here, the snakehead fish, Channa argus) in the fish species Spinibarbus sinensis, known as qingbo. Unexpectedly, prior predator experience showed no significant effect on inspection behaviour as demonstrated by either the frequency or the duration of each activity outside shelter or on cooperation as demonstrated by the inter-individual distance or synchronization of speed. This may have been due to the different adjustments in behaviour among individuals (more shelter use vs. more inspection), the predator treatment used in the present study (exposure to caged predator rather than direct predation) and/or a species-specific strategy in the qingbo. The starved fish displayed shorter inspection latency, increased inspection behaviour and greater cooperation when measured without the predator; however, when measured in the presence of the predator, the starved fish showed increased inspection frequency but shorter inspection duration, possibly due to the compromise between energy needs and predation risk. Similar to those of the predation group, the fish from the double-treated group showed no difference in inspection behaviour compared to the control group under the predator-absent condition, while the high-frequency, short-duration inspection behaviours remained the same as in the starved group. These findings suggested that the adjustment of inspection behaviour and related cooperation are rather complicated according to either predator experience or food deprivation, partially due to the inter-individual differences in behavioural adjustment and/or different environmental conditions.",MA208,NM,include,both,competition-cooperation; predator-prey
Inter individual variations of the fish skin microbiota: Host genetics basis of mutualism?,"The commensal microbiota of fish skin is suspected to provide a protection against opportunist infections. The skin of fish harbors a complex and diverse microbiota that closely interacts with the surrounding water microbial communities. Up to now there is no clear evidence as to whether the host regulates the recruitment of environmental bacteria to build a specific skin microbiota. To address this question, we detected Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with the abundance of specific skin microbiota bacterial strains in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), combining 16S RNA tagged-amplicon 454 pyrosequencing with genetic linkage analysis. Skin microbiota analysis revealed high inter-individual variation among 86 F2 fish progeny based upon the relative abundance of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Out of those OTUs, the pathogenic strain Flavobacterium psychrophilum and the non-pathogenic strain Methylobacterium rhodesianum explained the majority of inter-individual distances. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was found between Flavobacterium and Methylobacterium , suggesting a mutually competitive relationship. Finally, after considering a total of 266 markers, genetic linkage analysis highlighted three major QTL associated with the abundance of Lysobacter, Rheinheimera and Methylobacterium. All these three genera are known for their beneficial antibacterial activity. Overall, our results provide evidence that host genotype may regulate the abundance of specific genera among their surface microbiota. They also indicate that Lysobacter, Rheinheimera and Methylobacterium are potentially important genera in providing protection against pathogens.  2014 Boutin et al.",MA209,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Interacting influence of mycorrhizal symbiosis and competition on plant diversity in tallgrass prairie,"In tallgrass prairie, plant species interactions regulated by their associated mycorrhizal fungi may be important forces that influence species coexistence and community structure; however, the mechanisms and magnitude of these interactions remain unknown. The objective of this study was to determine how interspecific competition, mycorrhizal symbiosis, and their interactions influence plant community structure. We conducted a factorial experiment, which incorporated manipulations of abundance of dominant competitors, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, and suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis using the fungicide benomyl under two fire regimes (annual and 4-year burn intervals). Removal of the two dominant C-4 grass species altered the community structure, increased plant species richness, diversity, and evenness, and increased abundance of subdominant graminoid and forb species. Suppression of mycorrhizal fungi resulted in smaller shifts in community structure, although plant species richness and diversity increased. Responses of individual plant species were associated with their degree of mycorrhizal responsiveness: highly mycorrhizal responsive species decreased in abundance and less mycorrhizal responsive species increased in abundance. The combination of dominant-grass removal and mycorrhizal suppression treatments interacted to increase synergistically the abundance of several species, indicating that both processes influence species interactions and community organization in tallgrass prairie. These results provide evidence that mycorrhizal fungi affect plant communities indirectly by influencing the pattern and strength of plant competitive interactions. Burning strongly influenced the outcome of these interactions, which suggests that plant species diversity in tallgrass prairie is influenced by a complex array of interacting processes, including both competition and mycorrhizal symbiosis.",MA210,NM,exclude,,
Interactions of spatial strategies producing generalization gradient and blocking: A computational approach,"We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.  2018 Doll et al.",MA211,NM,exclude,,
Intra- and interindividual differences in the costs and benefits of intergroup aggression in female vervet monkeys,"In social species, fighting in intergroup conflicts is one of the riskiest cooperative activities group members engage in, particularly for individuals of the smaller sex. In a number of species, female group members are significantly smaller than males, so the costs associated with intergroup aggression outweigh the potential benefits and females avoid participating. Studies conducted on species in which females are active participants have consistently found that they fight to defend access to food resources and that high-ranking females tend to be more active than low-rankers. However, additional factors may modulate the costs and benefits of participation, creating differences between individuals and variability within individuals over time. In this study, we investigated costs and benefits that potentially affect female vervet monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, participation in intergroup conflicts. We observed the participation of 35 females in three groups, during 115 intergroup conflicts. Our findings suggest that female vervet monkeys defend access to valuable food resources, as well as to areas that are intensely used in the long term; however, rank also influenced female participation indicating that the potential benefits gained from resource defence vary with one's priority of access to these resources. We found that females were more likely to participate aggressively when they did not have an infant, and when they received more male support throughout the intergroup conflict, suggesting these factors influence the perceived risk, or costs, of intergroup aggression. Because we observed considerable temporal variability in both the proportion of female group members with infants and the number and identity of male group members (i.e. amount of male support provided), the relative fighting ability of neighbouring groups will inevitably fluctuate. Thus, our findings may help explain the lack of stable intergroup dominance relationships observed in many studies of intergroup conflict. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Intra- and Intersexual Conflicts and Cooperation in the Evolution of Mating Strategies: Lessons Learnt From Ungulates,"The traditional narrow focus on male mate competition in studies of mammalian mating strategies has been successful in explaining many conspicuous outcomes of sexual selection. However, focusing on ungulates, I here review increasing evidence that a comprehensive understanding of sexually selected adaptations requires consideration of a broader range of sex roles, particularly those relating to female behaviour. I show how mate competition and mate choice in both sexes can interact and often lead to intra- and intersexual conflicts and sometimes also cooperation. By causing phenotypic selection, these behavioural interactions can shape evolution although the outcome depends on genetic constraints. I conclude that to advance the understanding of mammalian mating systems we must broaden our conceptual framework from being largely focused on male competitive strategies to encompass coevolutionary dynamics between the mating strategies of both sexes. Future challenges include clarifying (1) the ecological basis for the inter- and intraspecific diversity in sex roles, (2) the condition-dependence of female mating strategies, and (3) the ultimate causes of mate competition and promiscuity in females.  2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",MA215,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; male-female
Intraspecific differences in plant chemotype determine the structure of arthropod food webs,"It is becoming increasingly appreciated that the structure and functioning of ecological food webs are controlled by the nature and level of plant chemicals. It is hypothesized that intraspecific variation in plant chemical resistance, in which individuals of a host-plant population exhibit genetic differences in their chemical contents (called plant chemotypes), may be an important determinant of variation in food web structure and functioning. We evaluated this hypothesis using field assessments and plant chemical assays in the tansy plant Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae). We examined food webs in which chemotypes of tansy plants are the resource for two specialized aphids, their predators and mutualistic ants. The density of the ant-tended aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride was significantly higher on particular chemotypes (borneol) than others. Clear chemotype preferences between predators were also detected. Aphid specialist seven-spotted ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata) were more often found on camphor plants, while significantly higher numbers of the polyphagous nursery web spider (Pisaura mirabilis) were observed on borneol plants. The analysis of plant chemotype effects on the arthropod community clearly demonstrates a range of possible outcomes between plant-aphid-predator networks. The findings help to offer a deeper insight into how one important factorplant chemical contentinfluences which species coexist within a food web on a particular host plant and the nature of their trophic linkages.  2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA220,NM,include,intraspecific,plant-animal interaction; chemical defences
Kinetics of aggregate formation in social insects,"A model for the kinetics of aggregation in social insects which accounts for stochastic effects arising from individual variability and covers both the early and the mature stages of the process is developed.

Limits on the bathymetric distribution of keratose sponges: a field test in deep water,"The keratose sponges (i.e. those in which the mineral skeleton is replaced by a collage nous skeleton) are generally restricted to shallow-water habitats, but the causes of this distinct bathymetric pattern remain unclear. Sharp pycnoclines at the depth of the upper slope may hinder colonization of deep waters because of thermal stress or reduced light and particulate food below the pycnodines. It is also possible that oligotrophy and loss of symbiotic cyanobacteria below the pycnocline may lead to a nutritional stress. Using manned submersibles in Exuma Sound, Bahamas, we determined that the pycnocline Lies between 70 and 100 m. We transplanted individuals of 2 keratose sponges (Aplysina fistularis and Ircinia felix) from their natural habitat on a shallow reef (4 m deep) to 3 depths (100, 200, 300 m) within or below the pycnocline to investigate mortality and changes in body size, shape and histology as a function of depth. We also recorded changes in populations of photosynthetic and heterotrophic symbiotic bacteria, as well as the parasitic polychaete Haplosyllis spongicola. By transplanting individuals of A. fistularis bearing buds for asexual propagation (fistules) and individuals of I. felix brooding embryos, we also tested the viability of reproductive propagules in deep-water environments. We found that, although these 2 sponges do not naturally occur at depths below 40 m, 62.5\% of A. fistularis and 42.8\% of I. felix survived at 100 m for 12 mo. No A. fistularis survived at 200 m, whereas 28.5\% of I. felix did. All sponges transplanted to 300 m died within 2 mo. Water tem temperature was the most Likely cause of sudden mortality at this depth. There were no significant differences in growth between individuals at the slope and controls on the shallow reef. Cyanobacteria were lost in individuals of I. felix that survived at 100 and 200 m, and these sponges repositioned oscules and formed chimney-like processes, probably to enhance water flow through the sponge and compensate for nutritional stress. By contrast, cyanobacteria were still abundant in individuals of A. fistularis surviving at a depth of 100 m, and these sponges did not change shape significantly apart from the loss of fistules. It appears, therefore, that the loss of cyanobacteria and the increasing oligotrophy with depth do not set the lower bathymetric limits of species. Removal of sponge tissues by the parasitic polychaete H. spongicola also appears not to aggravate significantly the nutritional stress experienced by sponges transplanted to deep water, at least to the extent that it may restrict the bathymetric distribution of the host. Despite the facts that only the species I. felix was heavily parasitized and that parasites survived within hosts at all depths, there was no significant difference in survival with depths between sponge species. A TEM (transmission electron microscope) examination of the mesohyl did not reveal significant cytological differences among sponges transplanted to various depths. At all depths, surviving individuals of both species showed archeocytes engaged in phagocytosis and digestion of cyanobacteria and/or heterotrophic bacteria. Similarly, collencytes and spongocytes were apparently secreting collagen, indicating that temperatures at 100 and 200 m do not inhibit the formation of the skeleton. Sponge recruitment derived from either asexual or sexual propagules was never observed at slope depths. Since adult sponges survived when they were artificially transported to deep waters, the inhibition of larval dispersal or settlement success (perhaps caused by the sharp decrease in temperature with increasing depth) emerges as the most plausible explanation for the shallow-water confinement of these keratose sponges.",MA232,NM,exclude,,
"MALE SIZE AND FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN THE EASTERN MOSQUITOFISH (GAMBUSIA-HOLBROOKI, POECILIIDAE)","In the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), earlier studies demonstrated that females direct more cooperative behavior toward large males.  Female eastern mosquitofish (G. holbrooki), including virgin and male-deprived specimens, which were given the opportunity to visually discriminate between two potential mates, showed no sign of sexual receptivity, nor preference for male size.  Furthermore, when test females were allowed to choose between conspecifics, males and females spent three times as much time near females than near males.  These results indicate little propensity of females to mate, irrespective of their previous treatment.  When several males were placed with a female, the largest was usually able to monopolize access to her.  Females encouraged this process by following the dominant male more closely and were, thus, found to favor the larger, dominant individuals.  The diversity in mating strategy suggested by this study is further evidence in favor of the separation of the western and eastern mosquitofish at the species level.",MA238,NM,include,intraspecific,male-female
Molecular evolution patterns reveal life history features of mycoplasma-related endobacteria associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,"The mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE), representing a recently discovered lineage of Mollicutes, are widely distributed across arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota). AMF colonize roots of most terrestrial plants and improve plant mineral nutrient uptake in return for plant-assimilated carbon. The role of MRE in the biology of their fungal hosts is unknown. To start characterizing this association, we assessed partitioning of MRE genetic diversity within AMF individuals and across the AMF phylogeographic range. We further used molecular evolution patterns to make inferences about MRE codivergence with AMF, their lifestyle and antiquity of the Glomeromycota-MRE association. While we did not detect differentiation between MRE derived from different continents, high levels of diversity were apparent in MRE populations within AMF host individuals. MRE exhibited significant codiversification with AMF over ecological time and the absence of codivergence over evolutionary time. Moreover, genetic recombination was evident in MRE. These patterns indicate that, while MRE transmission is predominantly vertical, their complex intrahost populations are likely generated by horizontal transmission and recombination. Based on predictions of evolutionary theory, we interpreted these observations as a suggestion that MRE may be antagonists of AMF. Finally, we detected a marginally significant signature of codivergence of MRE with Glomeromycota and the Endogone lineage of Mucoromycotina, implying that the symbiosis between MRE and fungi may predate the divergence between these two groups of fungi.",MA249,NM,exclude,,
"No evidence for host specialization or host-race formation in the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a fish that parasitizes freshwater mussels","Coevolutionary relationships between parasites and hosts can elevate the rate of evolutionary changes owing to reciprocal adaptations between coevolving partners. Such relationships can result in the evolution of host specificity. Recent methodological advances have permitted the recognition of cryptic lineages, with important consequences for our understanding of biological diversity. We used the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a freshwater fish that parasitizes unionid mussels, to investigate host specialization across regions of recent and ancient sympatry between coevolving partners. We combined genetic data (12 microsatellite and 2 mitochondrial markers) from five populations with experimental data for possible mechanisms of host species recognition (imprinting and conditioning). We found no strong evidence for the existence of cryptic lineages in R. amarus, though a small proportion of variation among individuals in an area of recent bitterling-mussel association was statistically significant in explaining host specificity. No other measures supported the existence of host-specific lineages. Behavioural data revealed a weak effect of conditioning that biased behavioural preferences towards specific host species. Host imprinting had no effect on oviposition behaviour. Overall, we established that populations of R. amarus show limited potential for specialization, manifested as weak effects of host conditioning and genetic within-population structure. Rhodeus amarus is the only species of mussel-parasitizing fish in Europe, which contrasts with the species-rich communities of bitterling in eastern Asia where several host-specific bitterling occur. We discuss costs and constraints on the evolution of host-specific lineages in our study system and more generally.  2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",MA257,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Nomadic-colonial life strategies enable paradoxical survival and growth despite habitat destruction,"Organisms often exhibit behavioral or phenotypic diversity to improve population fitness in the face of environmental variability. When each behavior or phenotype is individually maladaptive, alternating between these losing strategies can counter-intuitively result in population persistence an outcome similar to the Parrondo's paradox. Instead of the capital or history dependence that characterize traditional Parrondo games, most ecological models which exhibit such paradoxical behavior depend on the presence of exogenous environmental variation. Here we present a population model that exhibits Parrondo's paradox through capital and history dependent dynamics. Two sub-populations comprise our model: nomads, who live independently without competition or cooperation, and colonists, who engage in competition, cooperation, and long-term habitat destruction. Nomads and colonists may alternate behaviors in response to changes in the colonial habitat. Even when nomadism and colonialism individually lead to extinction, switching between these strategies at the appropriate moments can paradoxically enable both population persistence and long-term growth.",MA258,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation
Nuclear and genome dynamics in multinucleate ascomycete fungi,"Genetic variation between individuals is essential to evolution and adaptation. However, intra-organismic genetic variation also shapes the life histories of many organisms, including filamentous fungi. A single fungal syncytium can harbor thousands or millions of mobile and potentially genotypically different nuclei, each having the capacity to regenerate a new organism. Because the dispersal of asexual or sexual spores propagates individual nuclei in many of these species, selection acting at the level of nuclei creates the potential for competitive and cooperative genome dynamics. Recent work in Neurospora crassa and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has illuminated how nuclear populations are coordinated for fungal growth and other behaviors and has revealed both molecular and physical mechanisms for preventing and policing inter-genomic conflict. Recent results from population-level genomic studies in a variety of filamentous fungi suggest that nuclear exchange between mycelia and recombination between heterospecific nuclei may be of more importance to fungal evolution, diversity and the emergence of newly virulent strains than has previously been recognized.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

On the reorganization of fitness during evolutionary transitions in individuality,"The basic problem in an evolutionary transition is to understand how a group of individuals becomes a new kind of individual, possessing the property of heritable variation in fitness at the new level of organization. During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual. We use the volvocalean green algal group as a model-system to understand evolutionary transitions in individuality and to apply and test the theoretical principles presented above. Lastly, we discuss how the different notions of individuality stem from the basic properties of fitness in a multilevel selection context.",MA263,NM,exclude,,
Ontogenetic shifts in a freshwater cleaning symbiosis: consequences for hosts and their symbionts,"Animal fitness is influenced by diverse assemblages of internal and external symbionts. These assemblages often change throughout host ontogeny, but the mechanisms that underlie these changes and their consequences for host fitness are seldom revealed. Here we examine a cleaning symbiosis between crayfish and an assemblage of ectosymbiotic branchiobdellidan worms to uncover what mechanisms drive changes in symbiont composition during host ontogeny and the consequences of these changes for both the host and symbionts. In surveys of a North Carolina river, the dominant worm species shifted from Cambarincola philadelphicus to Cambarincola ingens as crayfish (Cambarus bartonii) increased in size. We demonstrate that this shift is a function of host regulation by small crayfish and exclusion by a dominant symbiont on large crayfish. In a controlled lab experiment, small crayfish often removed their symbionts but C. ingens was removed at a higher rate than C. philadelphicus. In contrast, C. ingens had higher survivorship and reproduction than C. philadelphicus on large crayfish. We also measured the effect of each worm species on crayfish growth through ontogeny; neither worm species had an effect on small crayfish but both species had similar positive effects on the growth of large crayfish relative to controls. Evidence from another experiment suggested that intraguild predation by C. ingens caused a decline in C. philadelphicus on large crayfish. We have shown that shifts in partner fitness are a function of host size and that these shifts can involve the succession of symbionts. Further, our results suggest that changes in the outcome of symbioses can remain robust throughout host ontogeny despite interactive mechanisms that lead to shifts in symbiont community structure.",MA264,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host

Overview on the Diversity of Sounds Produced by Clownfishes (Pomacentridae): Importance of Acoustic Signals in Their Peculiar Way of Life,"Background: Clownfishes (Pomacentridae) are brightly colored coral reef fishes well known for their mutualistic symbiosis with tropical sea anemones. These fishes live in social groups in which there is a size-based dominance hierarchy. In this structure where sex is socially controlled, agonistic interactions are numerous and serve to maintain size differences between individuals adjacent in rank. Clownfishes are also prolific callers whose sounds seem to play an important role in the social hierarchy. Here, we aim to review and to synthesize the diversity of sounds produced by clownfishes in order to emphasize the importance of acoustic signals in their way of life. Methodology/Principal Findings: Recording the different acoustic behaviors indicated that sounds are divided into two main categories: aggressive sounds produced in conjunction with threat postures (charge and chase), and submissive sounds always emitted when fish exhibited head shaking movements (i.e. a submissive posture). Both types of sounds showed size-related intraspecific variation in dominant frequency and pulse duration: smaller individuals produce higher frequency and shorter duration pulses than larger ones, and inversely. Consequently, these sonic features might be useful cues for individual recognition within the group. This observation is of significant importance due to the size-based hierarchy in clownfish group. On the other hand, no acoustic signal was associated with the different reproductive activities. Conclusions/Significance: Unlike other pomacentrids, sounds are not produced for mate attraction in clownfishes but to reach and to defend the competition for breeding status, which explains why constraints are not important enough for promoting call diversification in this group.  2012 Colleye, Parmentier.",MA266,NM,exclude,,
"Parasitism, personality and cognition in fish","It is well established that parasites can have profound effects on the behaviour of host organisms, and that individual differences in behaviour can influence susceptibility to parasite infections. Recently, two major themes of research have developed. First, there has been a growing interest in the proximate, mechanistic processes underpinning parasite-associated behaviour change, and the interactive roles of the neuro-, immune, and other physiological systems in determining relationships between behaviour and infection susceptibility. Secondly, as the study of behaviour has shifted away from one-off measurements of single behaviours and towards a behavioural syndromes/personality framework, research is starting to focus on the consequences of parasite infection for temporal and contextual consistency of behaviour, and on the implications of different personality types for infection susceptibility. In addition, there is increasing interest in the potential for relationships between cognition and personality to also have implications for host-parasite interactions. As models well-suited to both the laboratory study of behaviour and experimental parasitology, teleost fish have been used as hosts in many of these studies. In this review we provide a broad overview of the range of mechanisms that potentially generate links between fish behaviour, personality, and parasitism, and illustrate these using examples drawn from the recent literature. In addition, we examine the potential interactions between cognition, personality and parasitism, and identify questions that may be usefully investigated with fish models.  2016 Elsevier B.V.",MA270,NM,include,interspecific,theoretical/modelling; parasite-host
Parental care: Adjustments to conflict and cooperation,"In many species parental care is needed to rear offspring that survive to reproduce, a good measure of benefits in fitness terms. Such care may involve major costs to the individual. Balancing benefits and costs of care almost inevitably leads to tensions among individuals that provide and use the resource 'parental care'. Thus parental care and with it parental investment (i.e. the ultimate costs of care) is enacted in a game of conflict and cooperation. Using mostly examples from mammals, I discuss Tinbergen's four questions as they apply to parental care. Phylogenetic analyses of parental care are complicated by substantial intraspecific variability of this trait. Understanding the physiological and ontogenetic processes underlying parental care behaviour helps to understand how differences in the cost of care depend on the state of parents and their environment. A deeper insight into the strategies of conflict and cooperation in care can be derived from consideration of the behavioural mechanisms available to participants. 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Patterns of helping effort in co-operatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos mungo),"In most co-operative breeding species, some individuals contribute much more to helping behaviour than others. The most well-established explanation of such variation is based on kin selection and suggests that, in the absence of detectable differences in relatedness, individuals who suffer lower costs for a given level of help should contribute more. Differences in helping effort between dominance/sex categories were investigated in co-operatively breeding banded mongooses Mungos mungo in Uganda. The most conspicuous form of help in this species is provided by individuals who babysit offspring at the den while the rest of the pack goes off to forage. Across eight groups, the survival rate of pups increased with the average number of babysitters guarding them, consistent with the hypothesis that helpers benefit the brood that they guard. There was no difference between dominant males, subordinate males and breeding females in total contributions to babysitting. Subordinate males, however, contributed more to babysitting in the mornings, which were the longest and presumably the most energetically expensive sessions of the day. In six litters in one well-studied pack, dominant males and breeding females reduced their contribution to babysitting for the period that females were in oestrus. By contrast, subordinate males increased their contribution to become the main babysitters during this time. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, where helping conflicts with breeding, individuals with little chance of direct reproduction can help at a lower fitness cost than those with a high probability of successful reproduction.",MA273,NM,exclude,,
Pest control: From chemical ecology to evolution. A hungarian perspective,"From 1880, the year of funding the National Phylloxera Research Station, the predecessor of the present Department of Zoology of the Plant Protection Institute, the main thrust of entomological research was towards solving practical problems in agriculture, which mission governs our recent activity and guides our plans for the future. Our studies on the behaviour of herbivorous insects have shown that oligophagy is mainly due to the sensitivity of the insects' chemosensory system to deterrent chemicals occurring in the non-host plants. This enables the use of antifeedants in pest control. In field experiments the insects found their hosts largely by chance, which has implications for crop rotation. The ability of learning in some herbivorous insect species has been demonstrated. It may result in induced preference for some otherwise avoided plants. Ecological studies indicated that predispersal seed predators do not necessarily affect plant population dynamics and that there is no interspecific competition among them. Studying the presumable processes that drive the evolution of insectplant associations resulted in elaborating the theory of sequential evolution instead of the theory of coevolution. In course of 30 year studies, female-produced sex pheromones were evidenced in behavioural studies, isolated, and chemically identified in cooperations with organic chemical laboratories, for a few dozens of lepidopterous species. Related sex attractants were established by means of field trappings for further dozens of species. Based on these results, the role of sex pheromones in maintaining reproductive isolation between taxonomically closely related, sympatric species, as well as the chemotaxonomical value of sex attractants in higher taxa of Lepidoptera are discussed. As a result of our studies on Elateridae (Coleoptera) we developed and optimized pheromone baits and traps for catching males of all important pest Agriotes click beetles in Central and Western Europe. The most effective pheromone combinations for each species were tested in a Europe-wide comparative effort, giving information on the probable importance of the respective species in the respective area. In Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera) we discovered sex attractants for 3 species of the genus Anomala, and floral attractants for 4 species of the subfamily Cetoniinae, all orchard pests damaging fruits or flowers. Traps were developed for these scarabs taking into consideration the optimal visual and chemical cues for each respective species. The trap and bait combinations show preliminary evidence that their use for direct control through mass trapping is possible. Among chrysomelid beetles, new trap types were developed for the western corn rootworm Diabrotica v. virgifera. These trap types are widely used in Europe for the detection and monitoring of the pest.

"Plant and insect microbial symbionts alter the outcome of plantherbivoreparasitoid interactions: implications for invaded, agricultural and natural systems","Understanding how soil microbial communities influence plant interactions with other organisms, and how this varies with characteristics of the interacting organisms, is important for multiple systems. Solanum spp. are a suitable model for trophic interactions in studies of agricultural and natural systems and can also provide useful corollaries in invaded systems. This study examined the influence of soil mutualist arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on growth of different Solanum types fed on by the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, in relation to the presence of the aphid facultative endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa. Four Solanum types comprising two wild species, S. berthaultii and S. polyadenum, and two accessions of S. tuberosum, were grown with or without AM fungi and infested with one of four clonal lines of a single M. euphorbiae genotype (two with and two without H. defensa). Two experiments were conducted to (i) characterize plant responses to AM fungi and aphids and (ii) assess whether soil AM fungi could influence the success of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi when attacking aphids reared on each Solanum type. In both experiments, similar patterns of plant biomass were observed in relation to AM fungal and aphid treatments. Solanum biomass depended on plant type and aphid infection with H. defensa. Plants exposed to aphids harbouring H. defensa had smaller root biomass, and therefore total plant biomass, compared to plants infested with H. defensa-free aphids. M. euphorbiae performance varied with aphid clonal line, Solanum type and the presence of AM fungi. Parasitoid success, measured as the proportion of aphids from which a wasp emerged, was highest from aphids that had fed on plants colonized by AM fungi, although this result also varied with Solanum type and aphid clonal line. Synthesis. The presence of soil AM fungi, combined with within-species plant and insect variation in key traits, can have subtle  but significant  effects on plant fitness and insect success. This study highlights the importance of exploring genotypic variation in plant and pest responses to soil microbiota to identify suitable biocontrol options.  2016 The Authors.

Playing styles and possible causative factors in dogs' behaviour when playing with humans,"Individual differences and causative factors could modify the behaviour of dogs in object related games played with a human partner. In a two-by-two within-subject design we observed 68 family dogs' behaviour when playing two different types of games (ball game and tugging) with two different play partners (owner or unfamiliar experimenter) ill order to categorize each dog's playing style. In all four conditions we have measured the following behavioural variables: tendency for possession, willingness to retrieve, behaviours related to fear/avoidance and aggression, and occurrence of play bows. We also calculated the relative duration of time when the dogs oriented ``outwards{''} from the play situation to the other non-interacting person (owner or ex peri me titer) during a session. Than we examined the effect of six factors on dog-human play behaviour: the familiarity of the play partner, the type of the game, the dogs' gender, age and breed, and the duration of daily active interaction between dog and owner. We used factor analysis to unfold the relationship among the recorded variables and revealed three factors that accounted for 63\% of the total variance. On Factor I variables measured in tugging with both the experimenter and owner had high loadings (labelled ``Motivation for tugging{''}). Factor 2 contained all variables measuring fear and avoidance (Fear/Avoidance), and Factor 3 consisted of variables measured ill ball game (Motivation for ball game). The cluster analysis of the dogs' individual factor scores classified them into 5 significantly different groups on the basis of their tendency to be involved in playing with a ball, a rag and to show fear/avoidance during the tests. Moreover, the gender (but not the age or breed) of the dogs and the duration of the daily active interaction with the owner had significant effects oil the distribution of dogs between the cluster groups. These results suggest that in play situations the behaviour of well socialized family dogs is influenced more by their motivation to play and to a certain extent by the level of fear than by the familiarity of the play partner or their possible general tendencies for cooperative or competitive behaviours.

Policing and group cohesion when resources vary,"The transition from competing individuals to cooperative groups has occurred several times in evolutionary history. The puzzle is why selfish individuals did not subvert cohesive group behaviour by taking resources without contributing to the group's overall success. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism are the two standard explanations for group cohesion. But many groups have evolved into cooperative units when relatedness was low and opportunities were limited for the strategic alliances required for reciprocity. A new theory was recently proposed in which individuals invest some of their resources into repressing competition between group members. Such policing increases the fair distribution of resources in the group and enhances group cohesion. The surprising aspect of this theory is that low relatedness is more conducive to the spread of policing traits than is high relatedness. Here a new explanation is developed of the biological processes that favour policing. The model is then extended in two ways. First, more realism is added to the theory by accounting for the full range of costs and benefits associated with competitive and cooperative traits within groups. Second, another surprising result is introduced about cooperative evolution. Small variations in individual vigour or resources can lead to large variations in individual contributions to policing the group. Stronger individuals often invest all of their excess resources into policing, but weaker individuals do not contribute to group cohesion.

"Population Dynamics and Growth Rates of Endosymbionts During Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera, Liviidae) Ontogeny","The infection density of symbionts is among the major parameters to understand their biological effects in host-endosymbionts interactions. Diaphorina citri harbors two bacteriome-associated bacterial endosymbionts (Candidatus Carsonella ruddii and Candidatus Profftella armatura), besides the intracellular reproductive parasite Wolbachia. In this study, the density dynamics of the three endosymbionts associated with the psyllid D. citri was investigated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) at different developmental stages. Bacterial density was estimated by assessing the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene for Carsonella and Profftella, and of the ftsZ gene for Wolbachia. Analysis revealed a continuous growth of the symbionts during host development. Symbiont growth and rate curves were estimated by the Gompertz equation, which indicated a negative correlation between the degree of symbiont-host specialization and the time to achieve the maximum growth rate (t{*}). Carsonella densities were significantly lower than those of Profftella at all host developmental stages analyzed, even though they both displayed a similar trend. The growth rates of Wolbachia were similar to those of Carsonella, but Wolbachia was not as abundant. Adult males displayed higher symbiont densities than females. However, females showed a much more pronounced increase in symbiont density as they aged if compared to males, regardless of the incorporation of symbionts into female oocytes and egg laying. The increased density of endosymbionts in aged adults differs from the usual decrease observed during host aging in other insect-symbiont systems.",MA289,NM,exclude,,
Quorum Sensing Signal Synthesis May Represent a Selective Advantage Independent of Its Role in Regulation of Bioluminescence in Vibrio fischeri,"The evolution of biological signalling systems and apparently altruistic or cooperative traits in diverse organisms has required selection against the subversive tendencies of self-interested biological entities. The bacterial signalling and response system known as quorum sensing or Acylated Homoserine Lactone (AHL) mediated gene expression is thought to have evolved through kin selection. In this in vitro study on the model quorum sensing bioluminescent marine symbiont Vibrio fischeri, competition and long-term sub culturing experiments suggest that selection for AHL synthesis (encoded by the AHL synthase gene luxI) is independent of the quorum sensing regulated phenotype (bioluminescence encoded by luxCDABE). Whilst results support the hypothesis that signal response (AHL binding and transcriptional activation encoded by the luxR gene) is maintained through indirect fitness benefits (kin selection), signal synthesis is maintained in the V. fischeri genome over evolutionary time through direct fitness benefits at the individual level from an unknown function.  2013 Chong et al.",MA295,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; bacterial signalling
Range expansion drives dispersal evolution in an equatorial three-species symbiosis,"Background: Recurrent climatic oscillations have produced dramatic changes in species distributions. This process has been proposed to be a major evolutionary force, shaping many life history traits of species, and to govern global patterns of biodiversity at different scales. During range expansions selection may favor the evolution of higher dispersal, and symbiotic interactions may be affected. It has been argued that a weakness of climate fluctuation-driven range dynamics at equatorial latitudes has facilitated the persistence there of more specialized species and interactions. However, how much the biology and ecology of species is changed by range dynamics has seldom been investigated, particularly in equatorial regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied a three-species symbiosis endemic to coastal equatorial rainforests in Cameroon, where the impact of range dynamics is supposed to be limited, comprised of two species-specific obligate mutualists -an ant-plant and its protective ant- and a species-specific ant parasite of this mutualism. We combined analyses of within-species genetic diversity and of phenotypic variation in a transect at the southern range limit of this ant-plant system. All three species present congruent genetic signatures of recent gradual southward expansion, a result compatible with available regional paleoclimatic data. As predicted, this expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of more dispersive traits in the two ant species. In contrast, we detected no evidence of change in lifetime reproductive strategy in the tree, nor in its investment in food resources provided to its symbiotic ants. Conclusions/Significance: Despite the decreasing investment in protective workers and the increasing investment in dispersing females by both the mutualistic and the parasitic ant species, there was no evidence of destabilization of the symbiosis at the colonization front. To our knowledge, we provide here the first evidence at equatorial latitudes that biological traits associated with dispersal are affected by the range expansion dynamics of a set of interacting species.

"Rates of parasitism, but not allocation of egg resources, vary among and within hosts of a generalist avian brood parasite","Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) deposit their eggs into the nests of other birds, which then raise the cowbird chick. Female cowbirds thus have limited options for impacting their offsprings development via maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact their offsprings phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs. There was no evidence for variation in cowbird egg components among or within host species. Our data indicate that cowbirds discriminate among host nests, but do not appear to adjust the composition of their eggs based on inter- or intraspecific host variation.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA299,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Recombination and selection shape the molecular diversity pattern of nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium sp associated to Medicago,"We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample, from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species, within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes. Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus, recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different loci.",MA300,NM,include,interspecific,parasite-host
Regional collapse of symbiotic specificity between lucanid beetles and canestriniid mites,"The intensity of interspecific interactions between hosts and symbionts varies among populations of each organism because of differences in the biotic and abiotic environment. We found geographic mosaics in associations between lucanid beetles (Dorcus rectus and Dorcus striatipennis) and symbiotic mites (Haitlingeria sp. and Sandrophela sp., respectively) that were caused by the collapse of host specificity in the northern part of Japan. Haitlingeria sp. was only collected from the surface of the exoskeleton ofD. rectus in south and central Japan. Sandrophela sp. showed host specificity in southern to central Japan but was found on both beetle species in areas where Haitlingeria sp. was not found. Because Haitlingeria sp. was able to reproduce on D. rectus collected from Haitlingeria-free regions and no significant differences were observed in average temperature between the hostspecific and nonspecific regions bordering on each other, we suggest that the expansion of Haitlingeria sp. in the north has been limited for unknown reasons. When both mites were placed together on D. rectus, only Haitlingeria sp. reproduced, probably because it killed Sandrophela sp., especially juveniles. Thus, we conclude that Sandrophela sp. has expanded its host use to include D. rectus in areas where Haitlingeria sp. is absent. We hypothesise that false host specificity in the canestriniids has been maintained by habitat isolation and/or aggressive behaviour toward competitors.We suggest that host-specific canestriniids provide benefits to hosts that do not develop countermeasures to exclude microor macroparasites from their surfaces.

Reproductive skew and the evolution of group dissolution tactics: a synthesis of concession and restraint models,"Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for the partitioning of reproduction among individuals within animal societies. One constructive criticism of the theory is that there are too many models, all of which have different assumptions and predictions, which makes it difficult to know what to test. Here we begin the process of tackling this problem, by re-examining the assumptions and predictions of basic concession and restraint models, two transactional models that are often tested as alternatives. Concession models assume that the dominant has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may yield some of the group's reproduction to prevent the subordinate from voluntarily departing. Restraint models assume that the subordinate has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may not claim all of the group's reproduction to prevent the dominant from forcibly evicting it. We show that the group dissolution tactics that individuals use ( forcible eviction or voluntary departure) need not be an assumption of the model, but rather they can be predicted using Hamilton's rule and the standard variables of skew models. We reveal that the assumption that one individual ( dominant or subordinate) has complete control over the allocation of reproduction is an idea common to both models, and we resolve this semantic difference by calling this individual `the allocator'. We show that, regardless of the group dissolution tactics that individuals adopt, the allocator's share of the reproduction always increases as relatedness increases, as group productivity increases, and as constraints on leaving to breed elsewhere intensify. We conclude that concession and restraint type models make qualitatively similar predictions, and should not be tested as alternatives. In summary, this study makes the transactional framework of reproductive skew more general, by eliminating restrictive assumptions, and more amenable to testing in the field, by clarifying assumptions and predictions.

These environments harbour complex and cryptic ecosystems dominated in terms of abundance and biomass by planktonic microbes including bacteria, archaea, viruses and eukaryotic organisms (such as protists and fungi).

"Sex differences in intrasexual aggression among sex-role-reversed, cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Julidochromis regani","In sex-role-reversed species, females compete for resources (e.g., mates) more intensively than do males. However, it remains unclear whether these species exhibit sex differences in the intensity of aggressive behavior in the context of within-sex contests. Cichlid fish in the genus Julidochromis exhibit intraspecific variation in mating systems, ranging from monogamy to cooperative polyandry with sex-role reversal. In the study reported here, we observed aggressive interactions among three same-sex individuals in Julidochromis regani in the laboratory and tested whether inter-female aggression was more intense than inter-male aggression. Although difference in body size strongly determined the direction of aggression in fish, aggression by a smaller-sized individuals toward larger ones was occasionally observed. This type of aggression was common between individuals of a similar body size (<= 5 mm) and occurred more frequently among females than males. In contrast, differences in body size and sex did not affect the frequency of aggression by larger-sized individuals against smaller ones. Bidirectional aggression (i.e., mouth fighting) occurred frequently when two individuals had similar body size, and there was no difference in its frequency between sexes. However, temporal analysis showed that females performed bidirectional aggression more persistently than males. These sex differences in the intensity of intrasexual aggression could be the behavioral mechanisms underpinning cooperative polyandry.",MA315,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation; male-female
"Sex-specific foraging during parental care in a size-monomorphic seabird, the Australasian Gannet (Morus serrator)","Sex differences in foraging behavior are typically studied in size-dimorphic taxa. Data on sex-specific behavior in monomorphic taxa are needed to test theories of reproductive investment. It has been suggested that in seabirds foraging niche separation may be related to decreased intersexual competition for food between cooperating pair-bonded individuals. Alternatively, sex differences in foraging niches may be driven by different nutritional requirements of females associated with the reproductive costs of egg production and oviposition. To assess these possibilities, we studied a size-monomorphic colonial seabird, the Australasian Gannet (Morus serrator) at the Cape Kidnappers gannetry, New Zealand. We recorded maximum dive depths, and distinct diet composition of incubating females as indicated by stable isotopic signatures. Results suggested greater female foraging effort during early times of incubation, indicated by significantly deeper maximum dives. Sex-specific foraging patterns across other breeding stages were more variable. Nitrogen stable isotopic values showed that incubating females occupied a different trophic position compared to males at the same breeding stage, and also from those of gannets of both sexes at later stages of parental care. Overall, the data are consistent with cost-of-oviposition compensation in females necessitating male-bias in parental care in biparental breeders. Further research is needed to unravel the implications of nutritional needs for the evolution of sex differences in behavior in this and other monomorphic taxa.",MA317,NM,exclude,,
Sexual conflict predicts morphology and behavior in two species of penduline tits,"Background. The evolutionary interests of males and females rarely coincide (sexual conflict), and these conflicting interests influence morphology, behavior and speciation in various organisms. We examined consequences of variation in sexual conflict in two closely-related passerine birds with contrasting breeding systems: the Eurasian penduline tit Remiz pendulinus (EPT) exhibiting a highly polygamous breeding system with sexually antagonistic interests over parental care, and the socially monogamous Cape penduline tit Anthoscopus minutus (CPT). We derived four a priori predictions from sexual conflict theory and tested these using data collected in Central Europe (EPT) and South Africa (CPT). Firstly, we predicted that EPTs exhibit more sexually dimorphic plumage than CPTs due to more intense sexual selection. Secondly, we expected brighter EPT males to provide less care than duller males. Thirdly, since song is a sexually selected trait in many birds, male EPTs were expected to exhibit more complex songs than CPT males. Finally, intense sexual conflict in EPT was expected to lead to low nest attendance as an indication of sexually antagonistic interests, whereas we expected more cooperation between parents in CPT consistent with their socially monogamous breeding system. Results. Consistent with our predictions EPTs exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in plumage and more complex song than CPTs, and brighter EPT males provided less care than duller ones. EPT parents attended the nest less frequently and less simultaneously than CPT parents. Conclusions. These results are consistent with sexual conflict theory: species in which sexual conflict is more manifested (EPT) exhibited a stronger sexual dimorphism and more elaborated sexually selected traits than species with less intense sexual conflict (CPT). Our results are also consistent with the notion that EPTs attempt to force their partner to work harder as expected under sexual conflict: each member of the breeding pair attempts to shift the costs of care to the other parent. More brightly colored males benefit more from desertion than dull ones, because they are more likely to remate with a new female. Taken together, the comparison between two closely related species with contrasting breeding systems suggest that sexual conflict over care has influenced the evolution of behavior and morphology in penduline tits.  2010 van Dijk et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA319,NM,include,intraspecific,male-female; competition-cooperation
"Sexual conflict, ecology, and breeding systems in shorebirds","Evolutionary biologists strive to understand the immense variation in animals' breeding systems. Shorebirds represent an ideal model system for this endeavor, because they exhibit diverse breeding systems that include monogamy, with the parents cooperating to rear the young; and polygamy by the male, the female, or both parents, with one parent taking full responsibility for incubating the eggs and rearing the young. Recent experimental manipulations, mathematical models, and phylogenetic analyses reveal that evolutionary pressures may diverge as they act on mated pairs of shorebirds, favoring one parent at a cost to the other. We argue that different reproductive payoffs for the male and the female have had fundamental implications for the evolution of diverse breeding systems.  2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.",MA320,NM,include,intraspecific,theory; male-female;
Sexual cooperation relies on food controlled by females in agromyzid flies,"A sex difference in mating optima generates antagonistic traits that impose costs on the opposite sex. This conflict can be mediated by food that increases mutual benefits. Although current understanding of sexual cooperation involving food is based exclusively on mating systems with male food control, recent studies have suggested universal female food control across taxa. However, there have been no empirical studies testing food's role in facilitating sexual cooperation in this scenario. Here, we examined the interplay of food availability and mating in the pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, the males of which feed on the exudates from the leaf punctures created by female ovipositors. Given the association between female oviposition and food production, we infer that food controlled by females may alter male optima in mating and thus modulate male courtship strategies for mating. Mating stimulated females to produce abundant punctures, which benefited male feeding and survival. When males were deprived of the punctures, they adopted an elaborate dancing behaviour, leading to increased receptivity of females. However, when males adopted an alternative strategy of directly approaching females, they obtained fewer punctures. After preferential mating with dancing males, females significantly prolonged their life span and increased offspring numbers. Sexual cooperation in leafminers can be explained by the nutritional composition of plant exudates, which we found contain abundant sugars and amino acids. The plant exudates are vital food for males, but their nutritional value and availability rapidly declined with time. Our study reveals that the food produced by females can provide mutual benefits to male survival and female reproduction. Our study of food control by females extends our understanding of evolution in sexual cooperation.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour",MA321,NM,include,intraspecific,male-female;
Signal categorization by foraging animals depends on ecological diversity,"Warning signals displayed by defended prey are mimicked by both mutualistic (Mullerian) and parasitic (Batesian) species. Yet mimicry is often imperfect: why does selection not improve mimicry? Predators create selection on warning signals, so predator psychology is crucial to understanding mimicry. We conducted experiments where humans acted as predators in a virtual ecosystem to ask how prey diversity affects the way that predators categorize prey phenotypes as profitable or unprofitable. The phenotypic diversity of prey communities strongly affected predator categorization. Higher diversity increased the likelihood that predators would use a `key' trait to form broad categories, even if it meant committing errors. Broad categorization favors the evolution of mimicry. Both species richness and evenness contributed significantly to this effect. This lets us view the behavioral and evolutionary processes leading to mimicry in light of classical community ecology. Broad categorization by receivers is also likely to affect other forms of signaling.",MA322,NM,include,intraspecific,predator-prey
Simple foraging rules in competitive environments can generate socially structured populations,"Social vertebrates commonly form foraging groups whose members repeatedly interact with one another and are often genetically related. Many species also exhibit within-population specializations, which can range from preferences to forage in particular areas through to specializing on the type of prey they catch. However, within-population structure in foraging groups, behavioral homogeneity in foraging behavior, and relatedness could be outcomes of behavioral interactions rather than underlying drivers. We present a simple process by which grouping among foragers emerges and is maintained across generations. We introduce agent-based models to investigate (1) whether a simple rule (keep foraging with the same individuals when you were successful) leads to stable social community structure, and (2) whether this structure is robust to demographic changes and becomes kin-structured over time. We find the rapid emergence of kin-structured populations and the presence of foraging groups that control, or specialize on, a particular food resource. This pattern is strongest in small populations, mirroring empirical observations. Our results suggest that group stability can emerge as a product of network self-organization and, in doing so, may provide the necessary conditions for the evolution of more sophisticated processes, such as social learning. This taxonomically general social process has implications for our understanding of the links between population, genetic, and social structures.",MA323,NM,exclude,,
Small and variable sperm sizes suggest low sperm competition despite multiple paternity in a lekking suboscine bird,"Sperm competition, whereby sperm from multiple males compete to fertilize an egg, selects for adaptations that increase fertilization success. Because fertilization success is related to sperm number, size, and quality, both interspecific and intraspecific variation in these traits are predicted to correlate with the level of sperm competition. Specifically, species and individuals that experience high sperm competition are predicted to produce more sperm per ejaculate, produce longer sperm, and exert higher quality control, resulting in reduced numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm and reduced size variation via selection for the most successful sperm phenotype. However, the causes of sperm morphological and size variation and its consequences for sperm competition remain poorly understood, especially within species. We quantified variation in sperm morphology, size, and number in the Lancetailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata), a Neotropical suboscine passerine with a cooperative lek mating system. Although alpha-status males sire almost all chicks, the numbers of sperm produced per ejaculate by betas, nonterritorial adults, and subadult males were similar to those produced by alphas. Sperm counts declined with age in alphas, which may explain the decreased siring success of older alphas. Most ejaculates contained both normal helical sperm and abnormal sperm with rounded heads. The proportion of morphologically normal sperm per ejaculate was unrelated to social status or age. The coefficients of variation in sperm component length (head, tail, and total) both between and within alpha males were comparable to variation reported in passerines with low sperm competition. Total sperm length was shorter than in the majority of avian species studied to date, and cloacal protuberance and relative testis size were small. These results indicate low sperm competition, despite evidence for multiple paternity, or that sperm number rather than sperm morphology may be a major postcopulatory mediator of male reproductive success in this species. This work represents the first thorough quantification of intraspecific sperm variability in a suboscine passerine.

Social bonds and genetic ties: Kinship association and affiliation in a community of bonobos (Pan paniscus),"Studies of captive populations of bonobos suggest that females are more gregarious than males. This seems to contradict assumed sex-differences in kinship deriving from a species-typical dispersal pattern of female exogamy and male philopatry. Here we present data on spatial associations and affiliative relations among members of one wild community (Eyengo) for which genetic relationships were identified by analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Our data from Lomako confirm the existence of spatial associations among resident females. In addition, they reveal strong social bonds between males and females. While most female-female associations did not last longer than one field season, long-term associations occurred predominantly between mixed-sex dyads and involved both close kin and unrelated individuals. Differences in social grooming appeared to be related to patterns of spatial association rather than to kinship. It is suggested that under natural conditions social organisation of bonobos is characterised by strong inter-sexual bonds. Males may benefit from bonding with females by increased reproductive success via rank acquisition. For females benefits may derive from inclusive fitness and reduced food competition. Preliminary evidence suggests that females also may benefit from protection by resident males against male intruders.",MA329,NM,exclude,,
Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study of wild baboons,"For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals social relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50% of live-born females and c. 44% of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood, both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation (i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming) are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast, in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in the particulars of their social environment.  2018 The Authors.

Some ecological roots of pest control,Development of pest management systems rests on relatively few major ecological principles and these underly the tactics and strategies available. Many are so self-evident that we often ignore their underlying significance. They are (1) the principle of inherent variation in the genetic properties of organisms; (2) the principle that an organism must be adapted to its environment and becomes so through its evolution; (3) the principle that all organisms require adequate nutrition; (4) the principle that to perpetuate their kind organisms must reproduce; (5) the principle that as organisms are born immature they must grow and develop; (6) the principle that life presents various compensations tending to correct for adverse occurrences; (7) the principle that most organisms derive their sustenance from other living organisms (predation); (8) the principle that organisms commonly suffer from depletion of resources by other organisms (competition among the same or different kinds of organisms); (9) the principle that cooperation serves many species well; (10) the principle that organisms must move about and do things (possess mobility and other behavior); and (11) the principle of holism and interactions among factors in ecosystems. Examples are given showing that advances in our knowledge in each of these basic areas are significant in developing ecologically sound pest management systems.  1974 Le Franois.,MA341,NM,exclude,,
Spare to share? How does interindividual variation in metabolic rate influence food sharing in the honeybee?,"A central benefit of group living is the cooperative acquisition and sharing of resources but the costs associated with these processes can set up a potential conflict between individual and group level fitness. Within a honeybee colony, the task of resource acquisition is relegated to the foragers and any interindividual differences in their metabolic rate and the consequent carbohydrate demand may pose a constraint on the amount of resources they can contribute to the colony. We investigated whether the carbohydrate demand of a forager is a function of her metabolic rate and if this impacts the amount of food she shares with the nestmates. Our results show that the sucrose consumption rates of foragers with high metabolic rates did not meet their carbohydrate demand, placing them at an energy deficit while those with lower metabolic rates had an energy surplus. Our food sharing experiments showed a trend but did not detect a significant difference among individuals with different consumption rates in terms of the amount of food they shared with their nestmates. These results suggest that honeybee foragers with different metabolic rates are likely to differ in terms of whether they have an energy surplus or deficit, but more long-term datasets may be required to detect how this may influence food sharing.",MA343,NM,include,intraspecific,competition-cooperation;
Species mtDNA genetic diversity explained by infrapopulation size in a host-symbiont system,"Understanding what shapes variation in genetic diversity among species remains a major challenge in evolutionary ecology, and it has been seldom studied in parasites and other host-symbiont systems. Here, we studied mtDNA variation in a host-symbiont non-model system: 418 individual feather mites from 17 feather mite species living on 17 different passerine bird species. We explored how a surrogate of census size, the median infrapopulation size (i.e., the median number of individual parasites per infected host individual), explains mtDNA genetic diversity. Feather mite species genetic diversity was positively correlated with mean infrapopulation size, explaining 34% of the variation. As expected from the biology of feather mites, we found bottleneck signatures for most of the species studied but, in particular, three species presented extremely low mtDNA diversity values given their infrapopulation size. Their star-like haplotype networks (in contrast with more reticulated networks for the other species) suggested that their low genetic diversity was the consequence of severe bottlenecks or selective sweeps. Our study shows for the first time that mtDNA diversity can be explained by infrapopulation sizes, and suggests that departures from this relationship could be informative of underlying ecological and evolutionary processes.  2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",MA346,NM,exclude,,
State-space modelling of the drivers of movement behaviour in sympatric species,"Understanding animal movement behaviour is key to furthering our knowledge on intra- and inter-specific competition, group cohesion, energy expenditure, habitat use, the spread of zoonotic diseases or species management. We used a radial basis function surface approximation subject to minimum description length constraint to uncover the state-space dynamical systems from time series data. This approximation allowed us to infer structure from a mathematical model of the movement behaviour of sheep and red deer, and the effect of density, thermal stress and vegetation type. Animal movement was recorded using GPS collars deployed in sheep and deer grazing a large experimental plot in winter and summer. Information on the thermal stress to which animals were exposed was estimated using the power consumption of mechanical heated models and meteorological records of a network of stations in the plot. Thermal stress was higher in deer than in sheep, with less differences between species in summer. Deer travelled more distance than sheep, and both species travelled more in summer than in winter; deer travel distance showed less seasonal differences than sheep. Animal movement was better predicted in deer than in sheep and in winter than in summer; both species showed a swarming behaviour in group cohesion, stronger in deer. At shorter separation distances swarming repulsion was stronger between species than within species. At longer separation distances inter-specific attraction was weaker than intra-specific; there was a positive density-dependent effect on swarming, and stronger in deer than in sheep. There was not clear evidence which species attracted or repelled the other; attraction between deer at long separation distances was stronger when the model accounted for thermal stress, but in general the dynamic movement behaviour was hardly affected by the thermal stress. Vegetation type affected intra-species interactions but had little effect on inter-species interactions. Our modelling approach is useful in interpreting animal interactions, in order to unravel complex cooperative or competitive behaviours, and to the best of our knowledge is the first modelling attempt to make predictions of multi-species animal movement under different habitat mosaics and abiotic environmental conditions.  2015 Prez-Barbera et al.

Symbiotic sympatric speciation through interaction-driven phenotype differentiation,"A mechanism of genetic diversification and reproductive isolation is presented based on the interaction-induced diversification of phenotypes. First, phenotypes of individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to instability in the developmental dynamics associated with the interaction among individuals. Later, through competition for reproduction and mutational change of genes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups ('species') are completely separated in terms of genes as well as phenotypes. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed theory for speciation works also under sexual recombination and provides a basis for the evolution of mating preference. The relevance of the results to natural evolution are discussed, including incomplete penetrance in mutants and the change in flexibility in genotype-phenotype correspondence. Possible experiments are proposed to verify the theory presented.",MA359,NM,exclude,,
Synthesizing perspectives on the evolution of cooperation within and between species,"Cooperation is widespread both within and between species, but are intraspecific and interspecific cooperation fundamentally similar or qualitatively different phenomena? This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra- and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research.  2017 The Author(s).

Testis size depends on social status and the presence of male helpers in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Julidochromis ornatus,"Cooperatively breeding animals, in which helpers may participate in reproduction with dominant breeders, are ideal species for examining intraspecific variation in testis size because they often exhibit both monogamous breeding (low risk of sperm competition) and polyandrous breeding (high risk) within a population. However, little is known about testis investment as a result of sperm competition in these animals. The substrate-brooding cichlid fish Julidochromis ornatus has a cooperatively breeding system, in which some males mate monogamously and other males reproduce as dominant breeders or helpers within cooperatively breeding groups, in which male helpers frequently sire young. We examined the relationship between testis investment and male social status in relation to the risk of sperm competition. As predicted from sperm competition models, in groups with male helpers, both the male breeders and the male helpers invested more in testes mass, compared to breeding males without male helpers. We also found a positive relationship between the testes mass of male breeders and their male helpers, suggesting that males increase their investment in reproductive capability under the risk of sperm competition. Sperm competition models also predict that larger testes are associated with increased siring success. Our paternity analysis supported this prediction; we found a positive relationship between testis investment by male helpers and the number of offspring they sired.  The Author 2006.

The bitterling-mussel interaction as a test case for co-evolution,"The European bitterling Rhodeus sericeus (Cyprinidae) spawns in the gills of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) and shows some obvious adaptations to this type of spawning, such as the development of an ovipositor. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the fish avoid species of mussels that have a high likelihood of ejecting their eggs prematurely. This leads to the question of whether the interaction between bitterling and mussels could represent a case of co-evolution, involving evolutionary responses by both species to selection imposed by the other. The evidence for and against co-evolution is reviewed, incorporating new results from two sets of experiments designed to test for adaptive choices by bitterling according to the mussels' sex and reproductive state, as well as a preliminary study of potential benefits for mussels from exposure to bitterling. Host preferences by bitterling, both among and within mussel species, may indeed have evolved in response to differences in benefits for offspring survival. There is no evidence yet for any benefits to mussels from receiving eggs, whereas there are costs due to reduced ventilation rates when the gills contain bitterling eggs. While there are differences among mussel species and individuals in their tendency to reject bitterling embryos, these differences do not provide strong evidence for co-evolution. For example, they may reflect differences in host physiology such as ventilation rate and generalized responses to expelling objects from their gills. Therefore, while bitterling are well adapted for their obligate spawning relationship with mussels, it has been much more difficult to find evidence for adaptations by mussels for dealing with bitterling. This suggests that any co-evolutionary dynamics between bitterling and mussels may be asymmetric, with stronger responses to selection by the fish than by mussels.  2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.",MA364,NM,include,interspecific,host-parasite
The distribution of Symbiodinium diversity within individual host foraminifera,"While one-to-one specificity between reef-dwelling hosts and symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium may occur, detailed examination of some hosts reveals that they contain multiple symbiont types. Individuals of the foraminifer Amphisorus hemprichii living in Papua New Guinea contained mixed communities of Symbiodinium dominated by symbiont types in clades C and F. Moreover, the types showed a distinct pattern in their distribution across the radius of the foraminifer, with clade F Symbiodinium more prevalent in the center of the host cell. The mixed community of symbionts and their pattern of distribution within the foraminifer is likely the result of processes happening both inside the foraminifer and in its external environment. Persistent mixed symbiont communities in foraminifera may be stabilized through benefits conferred by maintaining multiple symbiont lineages for symbiont shuffling. Alternatively they may be stabilized through a heterogeneous internal host environment, partitioning of symbiont functional roles or limitation of symbiont reproduction by the host. Six factors generally determine the presence of any particular symbiont type within a foraminifer: mode of transmission, availability from the environment, recognition by the host, regulation by the host, competition between lineages, and fitness of the holobiont.

The Ecological Perspective of Microbial Communities in Two Pairs of Competitive Hawaiian Native and Invasive Macroalgae,"Marine macroalgae are known to harbor large populations of microbial symbionts, and yet, microbe symbiosis in invasive macroalgae remains largely unknown. In this study, we applied molecular methods to study microbial communities associated with two invasive algae Acanthophora spicifera and Gracilaria salicornia and the two native algae Gracilaria coronopifolia and Laurencia nidifica at spatial and temporal scales in Hawaiian coral reef ecosystems. Bacterial communities of both the invasive and native macroalgae displayed little spatial and temporal variations, suggesting consistent and stable bacterial associations with these macroalgae. Results of this study identified three types of bacterial populations: nonspecific (present in both algal and water samples); algae-specific (found in all algal species); and species-specific (only found in individual species). The bacterial diversity of invasive algae was lower than that of their native counterparts at phylum and species levels. Notably, the vast majority (71 %) of bacterial communities associated with the invasive algae G. salicornia were representatives of Cyanobacteria, suggesting a potential ecological significance of symbiotic Cyanobacteria.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",MA368,NM,exclude,,
The effect of keystone individuals on collective outcomes can be mediated through interactions or behavioral persistence,"Collective behavior emerges from interactions among group members who often vary in their behavior. The presence of just one or a few keystone individuals, such as leaders or tutors, may have a large effect on collective outcomes. These individuals can catalyze behavioral changes in other group members, thus altering group composition and collective behavior. The influence of keystone individuals on group function may lead to trade-offs between ecological situations, because the behavioral composition they facilitate may be suitable in one situation but not another. We use computer simulations to examine various mechanisms that allow keystone individuals to exert their influence on group members. We further discuss a trade-off between two potentially conflicting collective outcomes, cooperative prey attack and disease dynamics. Our simulations match empirical data from a social spider system and produce testable predictions for the causes and consequences of the influence of keystone individuals on group composition and collective outcomes. We find that a groups behavioral composition can be impacted by the keystone individual through changes to interaction patterns or behavioral persistence over time. Group behavioral composition and the mechanisms that drive the distribution of phenotypes influence collective outcomes and lead to trade-offs between disease dynamics and cooperative prey attack.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

The evolution of cooperation by negotiation in a noisy world,"Cooperative interactions among individuals are ubiquitous despite the possibility of exploitation by selfish free riders. One mechanism that may promote cooperation is negotiation': individuals altering their behaviour in response to the behaviour of others. Negotiating individuals decide their actions through a recursive process of reciprocal observation, thereby reducing the possibility of free riding. Evolutionary games with response rules have shown that infinitely many forms of the rule can be evolutionarily stable simultaneously, unless there is variation in individual quality. This potentially restricts the conditions under which negotiation could maintain cooperation. Organisms interact with one another in a noisy world in which cooperative effort and the assessment of effort may be subject to error. Here, we show that such noise can make the number of evolutionarily stable rules finite, even without quality variation, and so noise could help maintain cooperative behaviour. We show that the curvature of the benefit function is the key factor determining whether individuals invest more or less as their partner's investment increases, investing less when the benefit to investment has diminishing returns. If the benefits of low investment are very small then behavioural flexibility tends to promote cooperation, because negotiation enables cooperators to reach large benefits. Under some conditions, this leads to a repeating cycle in which cooperative behaviour rises and falls over time, which may explain between-population differences in cooperative behaviour. In other conditions, negotiation leads to extremely high levels of cooperative behaviour, suggesting that behavioural flexibility could facilitate the evolution of eusociality in the absence of high relatedness.",MA372,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation
The evolution of cooperative turn-taking in animal conflict,"Background: A fundamental assumption in animal socio-ecology is that animals compete over limited resources. This view has been challenged by the finding that individuals might cooperatively partition resources by ""taking turns"". Turn-taking occurs when two individuals coordinate their agonistic behaviour in a way that leads to an alternating pattern in who obtains a resource without engaging in costly fights. Cooperative turn-taking has been largely ignored in models of animal conflict and socio-ecological models that explain the evolution of social behaviours based only on contest and scramble competition. Currently it is unclear whether turn-taking should be included in socio-ecological models because the evolution of turn-taking is not well understood. In particular, it is unknown whether turn-taking can evolve when fighting costs and assessment of fighting abilities are not fixed but emerge from evolved within-fight behaviour. We address this problem with an evolutionary agent-based model. Results: We found that turn-taking evolves for small resource values, alongside a contest strategy that leads to stable dominance relationships. Turn-taking leads to egalitarian societies with unclear dominance relationships and non-linear dominance hierarchies. Evolutionary stability of turn-taking emerged despite strength differences among individuals and the possibility to evolve within-fight behaviour that allows good assessment of fighting abilities. Evolutionary stability emerged from frequency-dependent effects on fitness, which are modulated by feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies. Conclusions: Our results reveal the impact of feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies, such as turn-taking. Similar feedbacks might be important for the evolution of other conflict strategies such as winner-loser effects or coalitions. However, we are not aware of any study that investigated such feedbacks. Furthermore, our model suggests that turn-taking could be used by animals to partition low value resources, but to our knowledge this has never been tested. The existence of turn-taking might have been overlooked because it leads to societies with similar characteristics that have been expected to emerge from scramble competition. Analyses of temporal interaction patterns could be used to test whether turn-taking occurs in animals.  2011Franz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA373,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation
The evolving dynamics of the microbial community in the cystic fibrosis lung,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung is a niche colonized by a diverse group of organisms, with a more limited number of species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominating in adult patients. Whether all members of this microbial community play a direct or indirect role in pulmonary decline has yet to be fully elucidated, but investigations of their interactions with both co-colonizing species and with host cells are beginning to shed light on their virulence potential. It is also emerging that some microbial species within this community adapt as chronic infection is established to survive the hostile environment of the lung, to minimize host clearance and to resist therapeutic intervention. This review highlights the recent developments in CF microbiology focusing on the cooperative, competitive and adaptive interactions of established and emerging pathogens in the lung microbiome.  2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",MA374,NM,include,intraspecific,host-symbiont
The forager's dilemma: Food sharing and food defense as risk-sensitive foraging options,"Although many variants of the hawk-dove game predict the frequency at which group foraging animals should compete aggressively, none of them can explain why a large number of group foraging animals share food clumps without any overt aggression. One reason for this shortcoming is that hawk-dove games typically consider only a single contest, while most group foraging situations involve opponents that interact repeatedly over discovered food clumps. The present iterated hawk-dove game predicts that in situations that are analogous to a prisoner's dilemma, animals should share the resources without aggression, provided that the number of simultaneously available food clumps is sufficiently large and the number of competitors is relatively small. However, given that the expected gain of an aggressive animal is more variable than the gain expected by nonaggressive individuals, the predicted effect of the number of food items in a clump-clump richness-depends on whether only the mean or both the mean and variability associated with payoffs are considered. More precisely, the deterministic game predicts that aggression should increase with clump richness, whereas the stochastic risk-sensitive game predicts that the frequency of encounters resulting in aggression should peak at intermediate clump richnesses or decrease with increasing clump richness if animals show sensitivity to the variance or coefficient of variation, respectively.",MA376,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation
The microbiology of seagrasses,"Like both terrestrial plants and other benthic marine organisms, seagrasses host abundant and diverse communities of microorganisms. These microbes fundamentally influence seagrass physiology and health, while also regulating the biogeochemical dynamics of entire seagrass meadows. Discrete populations of bacteria, fungi, microalgae, archaea and viruses inhabit seagrass leaves, roots and rhizomes and the surrounding sediments. The plethora of ecological interactions taking place between seagrasses and this microbiome span the continuum of symbiotic relationships from mutualism to parasitism. Indeed, the metabolic activities of some seagrass associated microbes, such as diazotrophic and sulphur oxidizing bacteria, govern the local chemical environment in ways that facilitate seagrass survival. On the other hand, pathogens, such as the protozoan parasite Labyrinthula cause disease outbreaks that can lead to mass seagrass die offs. While the role of the seagrass microbiome in defining the success of seagrass habitats is becoming increasingly apparent, there is still much to be learnt. For instance, the development of an understanding of how seagrass associated microbes may buffer or augment the negative impacts of growing environmental pressures will be valuable for informing decisions regarding the management and conservation of threatened seagrass habitats. In this chapter we will synthesise the current state of knowledge on the microbiology of seagrasses, with a goal of conveying the often overlooked importance of the seagrass microbiome in governing seagrass health and the biogeochemical stability of seagrass ecosystems.

The oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi supports a Cretaceous diversification of fungal-arthropod symbioses,"Paleoophiocordyceps coccophagus, a fungal parasite of a scale insect from the Early Cretaceous (Upper Albian), is reported and described here. This fossil not only provides the oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi but also contains morphological features similar to asexual states of Hirsutella and Hymenostilbe of the extant genus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). Because species of Hypocreales collectively exhibit a broad range of nutritional modes and symbioses involving plants, animals and other fungi, we conducted ancestral host reconstruction coupled with phylogenetic dating analyses calibrated with P. coccophagus. These results support a plant-based ancestral nutritional mode for Hypocreales, which then diversified ecologically through a dynamic process of intra- and interkingdom host shifts involving fungal, higher plant and animal hosts. This is especially evident in the families Cordycipitaceae, Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae, which are characterized by a high occurrence of insect pathogens. The ancestral ecologies of Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae are inferred to be animal pathogens, a trait inherited from a common ancestor, whereas the ancestral host affiliation of Cordycipitaceae was not resolved. Phylogenetic dating supports both a Jurassic origin of fungal-animal symbioses within Hypocreales and parallel diversification of all three insect pathogenic families during the Cretaceous, concurrent with the diversification of insects and angiosperms.

The varying relationship between helping and individual quality,"Individuals of different quality often differ in their helping behavior, but sometimes it is the high-quality individuals who help most (e.g., human meat sharing, vigilance) and other times it is the low-quality individuals (e.g., reproductive queues, primate grooming). We argue that these differences depend on individual differences in the performance costs of actually helping, the opportunity costs from forsaking alternative activities, and the fitness benefits for engaging the help. If helping is more difficult for some individuals to do (quality-dependent help), it will usually be done by high-quality individuals, whereas help that all individuals could do equally well (quality-independent help) will be done by whoever pays lower opportunity costs. Our model makes novel predictions about many kinds of helping, allows us to categorize different types of helping by their relationship with individual quality, and is general enough to apply to many situations. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any other type of (nonhelping) behavior where there are individual differences in benefits, performance costs, or opportunity costs.",MA390,NM,include,intraspecific,theoretical/modelling; competition-cooperation
Three old and one new: Protein import into red algal-derived plastids surrounded by four membranes,"Engulfment of a red or green alga by another eukaryote and subsequent reduction of the symbiont to an organelle, termed a complex plastid, is a process known as secondary endosymbiosis and is shown in a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms. Important members are heterokontophytes, haptophytes, cryptophytes, and apicomplexan parasites, all of them with complex plastids of red algal origin surrounded by four membranes. Although the evolutionary relationship between these organisms is still debated, they share common mechanisms for plastid protein import. In this review, we describe recent findings and current models on preprotein import into complex plastids with a special focus on the second outermost plastid membrane. Derived from the plasma membrane of the former endosymbiont, the evolution of protein transport across this so-called periplastidal membrane most likely represented the challenge in the transition from an endosymbiont to a host-dependent organelle. Here, remodeling and relocation of the symbiont endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery gave rise to a translocon complex termed symbiont-specific ERAD-like machinery and provides a fascinating insight into complex cellular evolution.  2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",MA391,NM,exclude,,
Unexpected structured intraspecific diversity of thioautotrophic bacterial gill endosymbionts within the Lucinidae (Mollusca: Bivalvia),"In chemoautotrophic associations, sequence comparison of 16S rRNA has been the method of choice to study bacterial diversity in the context of host/symbiont coevolution. However, the relative low rate of evolution of 16S rRNA has been shown to result in a diminished capacity to discriminate between closely related bacterial strains or species. Within chemoautotrophic associations, as described in several studies, the use of other genetic markers may reveal previously unobserved strain diversity among gill endosymbionts. Herein, we conducted a survey of symbionts harbored by six species within the Lucinidae family using five genetic markers (dnaE, gyrB, aprA, cbbL genes and the 16S23S internal transcribed spacer). Thus, within the already described SoLuc_1 bacterial species shared by six host species we observed an obvious bacterial strain diversity. This diversity is structured in function of the geographic location of the hosts and not in function of ecological parameters or host phylogeny. Interestingly at the local level (same seagrass bed environment), we observed an unexpected specificity in host species/bacterial strain association (i.e., all individuals of the same host species harbor the same symbiotic sequence type). This specificity of association implied that there was a control of symbiont strain acquisition by the host, which was confirmed by a cross-infection experiment of starved adults performed in our study. Based upon our results and other evidence from the literature, we hypothesize that this pattern may be due to a capture/escape type antagonist evolution of the two partners.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA400,NM,exclude,,
Variation in growth of Damaraland mole-rats is explained by competition rather than by functional specialization for different tasks,"In some eusocial insect societies, adaptation to the division of labour results in multimodal size variation among workers. It has been suggested that variation in size and growth among non-breeders in naked and Damaraland mole-rats may similarly reflect functional divergence associated with different cooperative tasks. However, it is unclear whether individual growth rates are multimodally distributed (as would be expected if variation in growth is associated with specialization for different tasks) or whether variation in growth is unimodally distributed, and is related to differences in the social and physical environment (as would be predicted if there are individual differences in growth but no discrete differences in developmental pathways). Here, we show that growth trajectories of non-breeding Damaraland mole-rats vary widely, and that their distribution is unimodal, contrary to the suggestion that variation in growth is the result of differentiation into discrete castes. Though there is no evidence of discrete variation in growth, social factors appear to exert important effects on growth rates and age-specific size, which are both reduced in large social groups.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts,"Wolbachia is a widespread, intracellular symbiont of arthropods, able to induce reproductive distortions and antiviral protection in insects. Wolbachia can also be pathogenic, as is the case with wMelPop, a virulent variant of the endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. An extensive genomic amplification of the 20kb region encompassing eight Wolbachia genes, called Octomom, is responsible for wMelPop virulence. The Octomom copy number in wMelPop can be highly variable between individual D. melanogaster flies, even when comparing siblings arising from a single female. Moreover, Octomom copy number can change rapidly between generations. These data suggest an intra-host variability in Octomom copy number between Wolbachia cells. Since wMelPop Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability. Here we tested if total Octomom copy number changes during the lifespan of individual Drosophila hosts, revealing selection for different Wolbachia populations. We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number. We show that despite the Octomom copy number being relatively stable it increases slightly throughout D. melanogaster adult life. This indicates that there is selection acting on the intra-host variation in the Octomom copy number over the lifespan of individual hosts. This within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts may be in conflict with between host selection against highly pathogenic Wolbachia.  2018 Chrostek, Teixeira.
