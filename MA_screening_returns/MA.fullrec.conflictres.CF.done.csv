MA339,"Sociosexuality, testosterone, and life history status: prospective associations and longitudinal changes among men in Cebu, Philippines","Sociosexuality is defined as an individual's interest in uncommitted sexual activity and can be measured in terms of both psychological orientations and behavioral expression. In socio-ecological contexts in which adults monogamously partner and cooperate to raise children, individuals with unrestricted sociosexuality are likely to prioritize mating/competition over committed partnering and parenting. Given the importance of mother-father cooperation in the evolutionary past, humans may have the capacity to facultatively and opportunistically downregulate sociosexuality to focus on priorities related to invested partnering and parenting. To date, no prior studies have used longitudinal data to track within-individuals changes in sociosexuality as it relates to such life history transitions. Given the lack of prior longitudinal research in this area, it is likewise unknown what physiological mechanisms might mediate within-individual changes in sociosexuality through time but testosterone is a plausible candidate. To explore these questions, we drew on a large, long-running study of Filipino men (n = 288), who were single non-fathers at 25.9 years of age and were followed up 4-5 years later. We found that men with more unrestricted sociosexuality at baseline were more likely to experience relationship dissolution by follow-up, consistent with past work. Compared to men who remained single non-fathers at followup, men who became married residential fathers showed shifts towards more restricted global sociosexuality as well as sociosexual behavior. Relative to their own baseline values, married residential fathers also had more restricted sociosexuality in all domains at follow-up. They were the only group for whom this was found. We found theoretically-consistent but modest support for positive correlations between men's testosterone and their sociosexuality, but no evidence that the two change in tandem together through time. Our results suggest that some amount of between-individual differences in sociosexuality are not stable and can facultatively shift alongside other aspects of male reproductive effort.",CF,include,intraspecific,
MA248,Molecular evidence for multiple infections of a new subgroup of Wolbachia in the European raspberry beetle Byturus tomentosus,"Wolbachia, a group of maternally inherited intracellular parasitic bacteria, alter host reproduction, including the induction of thelytokous parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, son killing and, most commonly, the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), in a diverse array of arthropods. CI can result in infertility and has attracted attention because of its potential in biological control and as an agent in speciation. Although there has been some analysis of overall infection rates in arthropods and within individual insect orders, there has been little exploration of within-species variation. In this study, primers specific for the ftsZ gene of Wolbachia were used to amplify it from different geographical samples of the European raspberry beetle (Byturus tomentosus), confirming the presence of Wolbachia. More than 99% of UK individuals were found to be infected with Wolbachia and 97% of these B. tomentosus beetles harboured multiple infections. Preliminary analysis of B. tomentosus beetles from continental European populations revealed a lower level of infection (24%) than those from the UK. Phylogenetic analysis using the ftsZ DNA sequences places Wolbachia from B. tomentosus into a new clade (Abt) within the A division, with some revisions to the existing Wolbachia phylogeny.",CF,exclude,,
MA22,Aphid-encoded variability in susceptibility to a parasitoid,"Background: Many animals exhibit variation in resistance to specific natural enemies. Such variation may be encoded in their genomes or derived from infection with protective symbionts. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, for example, exhibits tremendous variation in susceptibility to a common natural enemy, the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi. Pea aphids are often infected with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, which confers partial to complete resistance against this parasitoid depending on bacterial strain and associated bacteriophages. That previous studies found that pea aphids without H. defensa (or other symbionts) were generally susceptible to parasitism, together with observations of a limited encapsulation response, suggested that pea aphids largely rely on infection with H. defensa for protection against parasitoids. However, the limited number of uninfected clones previously examined, and our recent report of two symbiont-free resistant clones, led us to explicitly examine aphid-encoded variability in resistance to parasitoids. Results: After rigorous screening for known and unknown symbionts, and microsatellite genotyping to confirm clonal identity, we conducted parasitism assays using fifteen clonal pea aphid lines. We recovered significant variability in aphid-encoded resistance, with variation levels comparable to that contributed by H. defensa. Because resistance can be costly, we also measured aphid longevity and cumulative fecundity of the most and least resistant aphid lines under permissive conditions, but found no trade-offs between higher resistance and these fitness parameters. Conclusions: These results indicate that pea aphid resistance to A. ervi is more complex than previously appreciated, and that aphids employ multiple tactics to aid in their defense. While we did not detect a tradeoff, these may become apparent under stressful conditions or when resistant and susceptible aphids are in direct competition. Understanding sources and amounts of variation in resistance to natural enemies is necessary to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic interactions, such as the potential for coevolution, but also for the successful management of pest populations through biological control.  2014 Martinez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",CF,include,intraspecific,
MA40,"Carapace relative growth of Trapezia Latreille, 1828 (Decapoda, Brachyura), crabs that are symbionts of hard corals, from Clipperton atoll and the Revillagigedo islands: Ecological and zoogeographical implications","Decapod metapopulation dynamics are better understood by confronting theoretical studies with empirical data. In this study, our goal was to analyse the morphometric characteristics and relative growth of the carapace of Trapezia bidentata (Forskl, 1775) and T. digitalis Latreille, 1828, crabs from the islands Clipperton and Revillagigedo, in order to assess the degree of inter- and intraspecific similarity of the four insular populations. We examined 325 specimens and identified four species: T. bidentata (72.9% of total abundance), T. digitalis (23.1%), T. formosa Smith, 1869 (3.4%), and T. corallina Gerstaecker, 1857 (0.6%). Three carapace measurements were taken for each specimen: carapace width (CW), carapace length (CL), and interocular distance (ID). The variables CL and ID were fit to a power equation taking CW as the reference dimension. As in other brachyurans, growth pattern analyses indicated an isometric type in all CW vs CL and CW vs ID relationships examined. Interspecific differences included a larger body size for T. bidentata and larger ID/CW for T. digitalis. Significant intraspecific differences in the two insular populations of T. digitalis were evidenced in the ID/CW ratio. In contrast, populations of T. bidentata were morphometrically closer. These results indicate a higher degree of connectedness of the parts of the T. bidentata metapopulation than of that of T. digitalis, probably due to differences in the duration of their larval stages. We think that the larger body size in T. bidentata might account for competitive advantages in food gathering and habitat selection over the remaining species. In turn, as a counteracting trait for its smaller size, the larger ID might allow T. digitalis a better ability to perceive 3D and to judge relative distances between objects, thus avoiding competitive combats and improving antipredatory or escape responses.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",CF,exclude,,
MA98,Do newborn domestic rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus compete for thermally advantageous positions in the litter huddle?,"Competition among mammalian siblings for scarce resources can be severe. Whereas research to date has focused on competition for the mother's milk, the young of many ( particularly altricial) species might also be expected to compete for thermally favorable positions within the nest, den, or litter huddle. We investigated this in newborn pups of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, a species in which the altricial young are not brooded by the mother, and in which competition for milk is severe. In eight unculled litters (N=86 pups) of a domestic chinchilla strain, we calculated huddling indexes for individual pups on postnatal days 2-5 as a measure of the degree of insulation they received from littermates. Pups maintained almost constant physical contact with the litter huddle. They performed brief but frequent rooting and climbing behaviors, which usually improved their huddling index, interspersed with longer periods of quiescence during which their huddling index declined. As expected, we found a significant positive relation between pups' mean huddling index and body temperature. Unexpectedly, however, we did not find a relation between huddling index and pups' birth weight, survival, milk intake, or efficiency of converting milk to body mass. We conclude that rather than competing for thermally advantageous positions within the huddle newborn rabbits share out thermally advantageous positions as they move in a continual dynamic flow through it. Thus, in newborn rabbits, competition for the mother's milk exists alongside mutual ``cooperative{''} benefits of littermate presence.",CF,exclude,,
MA183,Host-parasite dynamics lead to mixed cooperative games,"Although the Prisoner's dilemma is a leading metaphor for the evolution of sociality, only a few studies demonstrate that this game indeed operates in nature. We offer an alternative perspective, in which parasites and their hosts are used as a model system, suggesting that Prisoner's dilemma may be rare due to different individuals experiencing variation in the payoffs they receive from alternative strategies. Ectoparasites (such as fleas) move stochastically between hosts, causing differential parasite burdens. The resulting variance in the need for cooperation - in this case cooperative allogrooming - means that payoffs for different strategies (e.g. cooperate and defect) are not fixed. Our simulations revealed that due to parasite dynamics, cooperation among hosts conforms to a mixture of two games: Mutualism and Cruel Bind, both of which are more likely to coerce individuals into mutual cooperation than Prisoner's dilemma. Though interesting, Prisoner's dilemma is in fact the least likely scenario. If payoff variation is common, the dominance of the Prisoner's dilemma paradigm may have made us unnecessarily puzzled by cooperation in nature.",CF,include,,
MA317,"Sex-specific foraging during parental care in a size-monomorphic seabird, the Australasian Gannet (Morus serrator)","Sex differences in foraging behavior are typically studied in size-dimorphic taxa. Data on sex-specific behavior in monomorphic taxa are needed to test theories of reproductive investment. It has been suggested that in seabirds foraging niche separation may be related to decreased intersexual competition for food between cooperating pair-bonded individuals. Alternatively, sex differences in foraging niches may be driven by different nutritional requirements of females associated with the reproductive costs of egg production and oviposition. To assess these possibilities, we studied a size-monomorphic colonial seabird, the Australasian Gannet (Morus serrator) at the Cape Kidnappers gannetry, New Zealand. We recorded maximum dive depths, and distinct diet composition of incubating females as indicated by stable isotopic signatures. Results suggested greater female foraging effort during early times of incubation, indicated by significantly deeper maximum dives. Sex-specific foraging patterns across other breeding stages were more variable. Nitrogen stable isotopic values showed that incubating females occupied a different trophic position compared to males at the same breeding stage, and also from those of gannets of both sexes at later stages of parental care. Overall, the data are consistent with cost-of-oviposition compensation in females necessitating male-bias in parental care in biparental breeders. Further research is needed to unravel the implications of nutritional needs for the evolution of sex differences in behavior in this and other monomorphic taxa.",CF,exclude,,
MA66,Complementarity in both plant and mycorrhizal fungal communities are not necessarily increased by diversity in the other,"Higher species diversity can improve community performance within a species guild when different species complement each other in their use of the available niche, such as through resource partitioning. However, species in one guild of organisms may act as resources for another such that the diversity in one guild alters the realized niche for species in another. Yet, it remains largely untested as to whether diversity in one guild of organisms influences species complementarity in another. The productivity and diversity in plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities can be positively associated with each other through their typically mutualistic exchange of resources. Here, we utilized these two interacting species guilds to determine whether greater diversity in one influences species complementarity in the other. This was performed by creating monocultures and a mixture of a grass, forb and legume in a full factorial design with monocultures and a mixture of four AM fungi. The presence of AM fungi reduced differences in the performance among plant species and greater diversity of fungi generally improved plant productivity over the average of the fungal monocultures. However, plant species complementarity was not greatest with a higher diversity of fungi and was only positive with a particular fungal monoculture. AM fungal abundance was not affected by plant diversity, but was greatly reduced in the grass monoculture compared to the other plant communities. Variation in fungal complementarity among plant communities was low overall and was little influenced by plant diversity.Synthesis. Using a model plant-mycorrhizal system, our results suggest that the composition rather than the diversity of species within one guild may be more influential in determining how species function within an associated species guild. However, our model system does not represent a broad gradient of diversity in either plant or fungal communities and only assesses the initial growth phase. Nonetheless, our results highlight that changes in species compositions in one species guild can affect the functioning of species diversity in another.",CF,exclude,,
MA152,"Food Sharing Patterns in Three Species of Callitrichid Monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, Saguinus midas): Individual and Species Differences","Food sharing (FS) in cooperatively breeding callitrichids is unusual among nonhuman primates because they regularly share significant amounts of preferred food with immatures and engage in proactive FS. However, it is still unclear which classes of individuals (males or females, breeders or helpers) engage most in FS, and whether differences exist among callitrichid species. In the first part of this study, we characterized general FS patterns in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). We found substantial adult-immature FS, and female breeders shared the least with immatures. This conflicts with previously published studies, where data were collected with the prevailing standard method of providing a food bowl to the entire group. In the second part, a comparison of our access-bias-free method and the standard method suggested that previous findings are likely the result of access bias. In the third part, we investigated species differences in adult-adult FS among common marmosets, golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), and red-handed tamarins (Saguinus midas). As common marmosets show lower levels of interdependence within groups, we expected more adult-adult FS in tamarins compared with marmosets. Adult-adult FS was indeed more prevalent in tamarins and not exclusively directed from male breeders to female breeders. Therefore, our results suggest that adult- adult FS in marmosets mostly reflects the high energetic demands of female breeders, whereas in the more interdependent tamarins, it may be used to reinforce cooperative bonds between adult group members.  2019 American Psychological Association.",CF,exclude,,
MA186,"Hot spots, cold spots, and the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution","Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations ({''}hot spots{''}) but not in others ({''}cold spots{''}). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.",CF,include,interspecific,

Moreover what forces keep beneficial bacteria from exploiting their hosts or from abandoning their hosts when better options exist?

MA404,Variation in growth of Damaraland mole-rats is explained by competition rather than by functional specialization for different tasks,"In some eusocial insect societies, adaptation to the division of labour results in multimodal size variation among workers. It has been suggested that variation in size and growth among non-breeders in naked and Damaraland mole-rats may similarly reflect functional divergence associated with different cooperative tasks. However, it is unclear whether individual growth rates are multimodally distributed (as would be expected if variation in growth is associated with specialization for different tasks) or whether variation in growth is unimodally distributed, and is related to differences in the social and physical environment (as would be predicted if there are individual differences in growth but no discrete differences in developmental pathways). Here, we show that growth trajectories of non-breeding Damaraland mole-rats vary widely, and that their distribution is unimodal, contrary to the suggestion that variation in growth is the result of differentiation into discrete castes. Though there is no evidence of discrete variation in growth, social factors appear to exert important effects on growth rates and age-specific size, which are both reduced in large social groups.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

MA279,PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATION IN ANIMALS,"Numerous examples are cited of physiological characters which, like morphological characters, vary genotypically, ontogenetically or phenotypically. Physiological variation is useful in describing interspecific relations, intraspecific variation and the limits of ecological range. Physiological variation of a character permits the establishment of populations at environmental limits and thus predisposes a race for genetic fixation of a character (Baldwin effect). Such variation is primary in providing one mechanism of reproductive isolation. Secondary physiological variation functions in habitat selection, particularly after reproductive isolation. Criteria for physiological variation are given by measurement of internal state in relation to environmental stress. In regulators a criterion is the point of failure of homeostatic mechanisms; in adjusters a criterion is the limit of tolerance after maximum acclimation. Both regulation and adjustment are adaptive to environmental change; in both types, phenotypic variation must be distinguished from genotypic variation. Examples of physiological variation in osmotic adaptation, in different populations of the same species, are given for species of Paramecium, Euplotes, Asterias, Gammarus, Callinectes, Anopheles, Onchorhynchus and Gasterosteus. Genetically different races have been established for Gasterosteus aculeatus and Euplotes vassus. Ionic balance has been little studied as a basis for variation of populations but specific requirements for some elements, such as copper and calcium, may have led to local differences. Stress of temperature extremes has induced many physiological variants. Closely related large homoiotherms differ in insulating capacity, smaller species differ also in metabolic response, particularly to cold. Poikilotherms differ in tolerance limits after acclimation, in selected temperatures, in metabolic level according to their temperature history, in Q 10 , in critical temperatures for reproduction and development. Physiological races with respect to temperature tolerance or selection are cited for species of Notropis, Micropterus, Gambusia, Pandalus and Carabus. Examples of metabolic differences in populations are found in aquatic but not terrestrial poikilotherms. Examples of races with respect to optimal temperature of development are found in species of Paramecium, Crassostrea, Urosalpinx, Daphnia, Drosophila, Lymantria and Rana. Criteria of variation with respect to oxygen are the halfsaturation value of transport pigments, the critical oxygen concentration, metabolic level, tolerance of products of anaerobiosis, auxiliary breathing mechanisms and stimulation of pigment development by hypoxia. Correlations of these functions with history of oxygen availability are cited, but data are inadequate to establish genetic races. Selection of specific food plants depends on secondary products, not primary food; many subspecies and races are known by food plant selection, especially among bugs, gall flies and butterflies. Preference can be transferred from one plant to another by forcedfeeding habituation; a food habit can be transmitted by behaviour from one generation to the next, or it may be fixed by genetic differences. Many genetic strains resistant to natural and artificial poisons are known. Light is an isolating mechanism for cave animals, for races differing in phototaxes, for races and related species differing in pigmentation and in establishing photoperiodic cycles. Variation in tolerance of type of substratum, of stream and of wind velocity isolates in some species. Examples of isolation by reproductive behaviour are given in crickets, Drosophila, birds and other groups. Selection of host by parasites and symbionts is a subtle isolating mechanism, probably based largely on chemical specificity. Serological incompatibility is a secondary mechanism in maintaining genetic intersterility. Physiological variation is usually accompanied by detectable morphological variation which may or may not be adaptive. Reproductive isolation may exist with slight physiological or morphological variation or conversely interbreeding may occur among very different populations. Need for physiological study of intraspecific variation according to history and distribution of natural populations is stressed. Copyright  1955, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",CF,exclude,,
MA275,Personality and density affect nest defence and nest survival in the great tit,"Recent studies suggest that individual variation in behaviour of prey individuals may cause distinctive responses to nest predators and cooperation with conspecifics. We assessed individual differences during a novel object test and whether these responses were related to nest failure and survival of females during incubation. We additionally carried out experimental trials in natural field conditions using a stuffed pine marten, a principal nest predator, to test for a relationship between neophobia and mobbing predators. Our results show that antipredator responses of breeding great tits are dependent on their personality and personality type of neighbouring conspecifics. We found that neophilic individuals (those that rapidly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) have an advantage over neophobic individuals (those that slowly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) in their reproductive success, as measured in numbers of successful nests and of females that survived. Furthermore, neophilic-neophilic pairs exhibited stronger antipredator mobbing responses than neophobic-neophobic pairs. Results show that consistent individual differences in response against novel objects and antipredator behaviour are related, and that these responses are important predictors of nest failure in breeding great tits.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.",CF,include,intraspecific,
MA299,"Rates of parasitism, but not allocation of egg resources, vary among and within hosts of a generalist avian brood parasite","Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) deposit their eggs into the nests of other birds, which then raise the cowbird chick. Female cowbirds thus have limited options for impacting their offsprings development via maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact their offsprings phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs. There was no evidence for variation in cowbird egg components among or within host species. Our data indicate that cowbirds discriminate among host nests, but do not appear to adjust the composition of their eggs based on inter- or intraspecific host variation.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",CF,include,intraspecific,
MA136,"Exploration is dependent on reproductive state, not social state, in a cooperatively breeding bird","Personality is an intriguing phenomenon in populations because it constrains behavioral flexibility. One theory suggests that personality could be generated and maintained if dependent on asset protection. It is predicted that trade-offs with fitness expectations and survival probability encourage consistent behavioral differences among individuals (personality). Although not mutually exclusive, the social niche specialization hypothesis suggests that a group of individuals that repeatedly interact will develop personality to avoid costly social conflict. The point at which behavioral consistency originates in the social niche hypothesis is still unclear, with predictions for development after a change in social status. In the facultative cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), residing on Cousin Island, breeding vacancies are limited and this forces individuals into different social roles. We used this system to test whether reproductive and social state predicted among-individual differences in exploration. We had 2 predictions. First, that an individual's start in life can predict personality, whereby young individuals with a good start to life (associated with early age reproduction and earlier onset survival senescence) are fast explorers, suggesting reproductive state-dependence. Second, that an individual's social status can predict personality, whereby dominant individuals will be fast explorers, suggesting that the behavior is social state-dependent. Neither of the behaviors was associated with social state and social state did not affect behavioral consistency. However, novel object exploration was associated with a proxy of reproductive state. Our results provide further support for state being a mechanism for generating individual differences in behavior.",CF,include,intraspecific,
MA362,The behavioral sciences and sociobiology: A darwinian approach,"Darwinian natural selection theory is the theory of choice for the overwhelming majority of behavioral biologists interested in the evolution of adaptive social behavior despite many challenges to the discipline of sociobiology over the years. The initial criticisms came from a group of ideologues who argued that sociobiology was based on a form of genetic determinism. This view was dismissed by working sociobiologists for several reasons but primarily because the criticism fundamentally misrepresents the goal of the discipline, which is to test hypotheses about the evolution and adaptive value of social traits and not to examine the proximate causes that influence the development of an individual's social behavior during its lifetime. Among the additional opposing views to the discipline that have been presented over the years are those held by academics who believe (1) that evolution occurs because of differences among groups (not individuals), (2) that kin selection theory (an amendment to Darwinian natural selection theory) has failed and should be dropped, and (3) that Darwinian sexual selection (a subset of natural selection theory) should be replaced by a more modern and inclusive theory of the evolutionary effects of the interactions between the sexes. This chapter debunks each of these competitors. Darwinian theory as modified over the last 50 years continues to be the basis for evolutionary research into the interactions between the sexes, helpful behavior in its various forms, especially the evolution of altruistic behavior, and all aspects of human sociality.
