Parabiotic associations between tropical ants: Equal partnership or parasitic exploitation?;1. The huge diversity of symbiotic associations among animals and/or plants comprises both mutualisms and parasitisms. Most symbioses between social insect species, however, involve social parasites, while mutual benefits have been only suspected for some parabiotic associations - two colonies that share a nest. 2. In the rainforest of Borneo, we studied parabiotic associations between the ants Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur. Parabiotic nests were regularly found inside hollow tree trunks, most likely initiated by Cr. modiglianii. This species frequently nested without its partner, whereas we never found non-parabiotic Ca. rufifemur nests. We experimentally investigated potential benefits, potential interference competition for food (as a probable cost), and foraging niches of both species. 3. The two species never showed aggressive interactions and amicably shared food resources. However, Cr. modiglianii had a wider temporal and spatial foraging range than Ca. rufifemur, always found baits before Ca. rufifemur and recruited more efficiently. Camponotus rufifemur probably benefited from following pheromone trails of Cr. modiglianii. In turn, Ca. rufifemur was significantly more successful in defending the nest against alien ants. Crematogaster modiglianii hence may profit from its partner's defensive abilities. 4. In neotropical parabioses, epiphytes grown in 'ant-gardens' play a crucial role in the association, e.g. by stabilization of nests. Hemiepiphytic Poikilospermum cordifolium (Cecropiaceae) seedlings and saplings frequently grew in the entrances of parabiotic nests in Borneo, obviously dispersed by the ants. In cafeteria experiments, both parabiotic ants carried its elaiosome-bearing seeds into the nest. However, P. cordifolium does not provide additional nest space, contrasting with neotropical ant-gardens. 5. The parabiotic association appears beneficial for both ant species, the main benefits being nest initiation by Cr. modiglianii and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur), and, in turn, nest defence by Ca. rufifemur (for Cr. modiglianii). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa.  2009 British Ecological Society.;MA267;CM;include;interspecific;competition, foraging-niches
Molecular evidence for multiple infections of a new subgroup of Wolbachia in the European raspberry beetle Byturus tomentosus;Wolbachia, a group of maternally inherited intracellular parasitic bacteria, alter host reproduction, including the induction of thelytokous parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, son killing and, most commonly, the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), in a diverse array of arthropods. CI can result in infertility and has attracted attention because of its potential in biological control and as an agent in speciation. Although there has been some analysis of overall infection rates in arthropods and within individual insect orders, there has been little exploration of within-species variation. In this study, primers specific for the ftsZ gene of Wolbachia were used to amplify it from different geographical samples of the European raspberry beetle (Byturus tomentosus), confirming the presence of Wolbachia. More than 99% of UK individuals were found to be infected with Wolbachia and 97% of these B. tomentosus beetles harboured multiple infections. Preliminary analysis of B. tomentosus beetles from continental European populations revealed a lower level of infection (24%) than those from the UK. Phylogenetic analysis using the ftsZ DNA sequences places Wolbachia from B. tomentosus into a new clade (Abt) within the A division, with some revisions to the existing Wolbachia phylogeny.;MA248;CM;exclude;;
Ontogenetic shifts in a freshwater cleaning symbiosis: consequences for hosts and their symbionts;"Animal fitness is influenced by diverse assemblages of internal and external symbionts. These assemblages often change throughout host ontogeny, but the mechanisms that underlie these changes and their consequences for host fitness are seldom revealed. Here we examine a cleaning symbiosis between crayfish and an assemblage of ectosymbiotic branchiobdellidan worms to uncover what mechanisms drive changes in symbiont composition during host ontogeny and the consequences of these changes for both the host and symbionts. In surveys of a North Carolina river, the dominant worm species shifted from Cambarincola philadelphicus to Cambarincola ingens as crayfish (Cambarus bartonii) increased in size. We demonstrate that this shift is a function of host regulation by small crayfish and exclusion by a dominant symbiont on large crayfish. In a controlled lab experiment, small crayfish often removed their symbionts but C. ingens was removed at a higher rate than C. philadelphicus. In contrast, C. ingens had higher survivorship and reproduction than C. philadelphicus on large crayfish. We also measured the effect of each worm species on crayfish growth through ontogeny; neither worm species had an effect on small crayfish but both species had similar positive effects on the growth of large crayfish relative to controls. Evidence from another experiment suggested that intraguild predation by C. ingens caused a decline in C. philadelphicus on large crayfish. We have shown that shifts in partner fitness are a function of host size and that these shifts can involve the succession of symbionts. Further, our results suggest that changes in the outcome of symbioses can remain robust throughout host ontogeny despite interactive mechanisms that lead to shifts in symbiont community structure.";MA264;CM;include;interspecific;host-symbiont
Endocrinology of sociality: Comparisons between sociable and solitary individuals within the same population of African striped mice;The social organization of species ranges from solitary-living to complex social groups. While the evolutionary reasons of group-living are well studied, the physiological mechanisms underlying alternative social systems are poorly understood. By studying group-living and solitary individuals of the same species, we can determine hormonal correlates of sociality without the problem of confounding phylogenetic factors. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) is a socially flexible species, which can be solitary or alternatively form complex family groups, depending on population density and the extent of reproductive competition. We predicted group-living striped mice to show signs of reproductive suppression and social stress, resulting in higher corticosterone but lower testosterone levels when compared to solitary-living individuals. To determine whether differences in social organization correlated with hormonal differences, we collected blood samples from free-living striped mice during four breeding seasons when we experimentally induced solitary-living in philopatric individuals by locally reducing population density. Striped mice that were group-living did not change their corticosterone or estosterone levels during the study, indicating that there was no temporal effect during the breeding season. Striped mice of both sexes had significantly lower corticosterone levels after switching from group- to solitary-living. Solitary males - but not solitary females - had higher testosterone levels than group-living conspecifics. Our results suggest that group-living results in physiological stress and can induce reproductive suppression, at least in philopatric males. The switch to solitary-living may thus be a tactic to avoid reproductive competition within groups, and is associated with decreased stress hormone levels and onset of independent reproduction.

Factors affecting individual participation in group-level aggression among non-human primates;Group members do not always act cohesively when facing extra-group rivals. When benefits such as group-defence are not monopolizable, it poses an economics problem: who should contribute to public goods and who should freeload? A collective action framework compliments existing theoretical explanations for cooperation, and provides testable hypotheses about group-level behaviour based on individual costs and benefits. Using this approach, we review research on intergroup encounters in non-human primates published over the last 20 years, focusing on participation by different classes of individuals. While food- and mate-defence explain much between-sex variation in participation, rank and reproductive access frequently explain within-sex variation. In some species, individuals may use intergroup interactions to survey potential transfer locations and mating options, which might coincidently intimidate rivals. Experimental evidence suggests that when intergroup dominance is based on relative number of fighters, individual participation still varies with sex, rank, companion behaviour and dependent offspring presence. Relatively few studies have examined how factors such as relationships within and between groups or individual temperament mediate aggression. Long-term studies of multiple habituated groups and methodological advances (e.g., playback experiments) will continue to improve our understanding of how complex group-level patterns are predictable when viewed from an individual perspective.  2007 Brill Academic Publishers.;MA138;CM;include;interspecific;review, cooperation, aggression
Leaf domatia and mites on Australasian plants: ecological and evolutionary implications;"Leaf domatia, specialized chambers in the vein axils on the underside of leaves of many plant species, have remained an enigma for over a century. In this study we show a strong association between foliar domatia and mites in 37 plant species in Australasia. Overall, mites accounted for 91% of the arthropods observed in domatia. Across all species, a median of 51% of domatia were occupied and 71% of leaves showed mite evidence in domatia. The level of mite association did not depend on domatia type (pit, pouch, pocket, or tuft) or provenance (Papua New Guinea, Queensland, Victoria, or New Zealand). Mite association with domatia commonly varied between plant species, between individuals within species, and between shoots within individuals. The leaf developmental stage probably explains much of the variation in association for many of these species. The presence of a variety of life history stages of mites within domatia indicates that these structures act as shelters for development and reproduction. Furthermore, in 12 of 13 plant species examined, domatia concentrate mites in particular locations on the leaf. Mite taxa that we classify as largely predaceous (e.g. phytoseiids, stigmaeids and tydeids) or fungivorous (e.g. acarids and oribatids) were most common in domatia and dominated the association in 21 of 24 plant species in which the relative abundance of herbivorous, fungivorous and predaceous groups was quantified. We evaluate hypotheses that explain the role of leaf domatia, including nonfunctional hypotheses (e.g. architectural constraints), physiological function (e.g. gas exchange and water uptake), bacterial symbiosis and antagonistic and mutualistic associations with mites. Our quantitative results confirm anecdotal accounts of mite association with leaf domatia and are most consistent with Lundstrem's centuryold hypothesis of plantmite mutualism in which leaf domatia billet predaceous and fungivorous mites that prey on plant enemies. Leaf domatia are widespread among woody angiosperms and abundant in many temperate and tropical regions of Australasia. Mites, an ancient group of arthropods whose diversity and abundance parallels that of insects, are likely to be important selective agents on terrestrial plants. Our results (1) indicate that mitedomatia association represents a relationship of comparable scope to plantant associations mediated by specialized plant structures such as extrafloral nectaries, food bodies and specialized domatia; (2) suggest that sociality is not a necessary prerequisite for widespread and diverse mutualisms between arthropods and plants; and, (3) extend the diversity of organisms that produce specialized mite houses from lizards, and wasps and bees to woody angiosperms. 1989 The Linnean Society";MA230;CM;include;interspecific;plant-arthropod mutualism
Variation in growth of Damaraland mole-rats is explained by competition rather than by functional specialization for different tasks;In some eusocial insect societies, adaptation to the division of labour results in multimodal size variation among workers. It has been suggested that variation in size and growth among non-breeders in naked and Damaraland mole-rats may similarly reflect functional divergence associated with different cooperative tasks. However, it is unclear whether individual growth rates are multimodally distributed (as would be expected if variation in growth is associated with specialization for different tasks) or whether variation in growth is unimodally distributed, and is related to differences in the social and physical environment (as would be predicted if there are individual differences in growth but no discrete differences in developmental pathways). Here, we show that growth trajectories of non-breeding Damaraland mole-rats vary widely, and that their distribution is unimodal, contrary to the suggestion that variation in growth is the result of differentiation into discrete castes. Though there is no evidence of discrete variation in growth, social factors appear to exert important effects on growth rates and age-specific size, which are both reduced in large social groups.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The role of frugivory in the diversification of bats in the Neotropics;Aim Ecological interactions are among the most important biotic factors influencing the processes of speciation and extinction. Our aim was to test whether diversification rates of New World Noctilionoidea bats are associated with specialization for frugivory, and how this pattern differs between the mainland and the West Indies. Location The New World. Methods We reconstructed a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the New World genera of the superfamily Noctilionoidea. We compiled data on diet, morphology, geographical distribution and number of ecoregions in which each genus occurs. Then, using the phylogenetic tree constructed, we tested whether diversification was driven by diet (animalivorous and sanguinivorous versus nectarivorous and frugivorous) and specialization for frugivory. Afterwards, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify correlates of species richness and net diversification rates. Results The diversification rate was higher in mutualistic than in antagonistic clades in mainland and Antillean biogeographical scenarios, but only strictly frugivorous clades showed a markedly higher diversification rate than the rest of the genera. Geographical range and number of ecoregions were positively associated with species richness and diversification rate in continental and insular lineages. Lower body mass, lower forearm length and specialization for frugivory were significantly positively correlated with higher diversification rates in continental lineages, whereas these parameters were negatively correlated in Antillean lineages. Main conclusions The direction of the relationship of intrinsic factors (specialization for frugivory and body size) with diversification of noctilionoid bats depends on the biogeographical context, whereas the direction of the relationship of extrinsic factors (geographical range and number of ecoregions) with diversification is consistent in both mainland and the West Indian lineages.;MA385;CM;exclude;;
Inter individual variations of the fish skin microbiota: Host genetics basis of mutualism?;The commensal microbiota of fish skin is suspected to provide a protection against opportunist infections. The skin of fish harbors a complex and diverse microbiota that closely interacts with the surrounding water microbial communities. Up to now there is no clear evidence as to whether the host regulates the recruitment of environmental bacteria to build a specific skin microbiota. To address this question, we detected Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with the abundance of specific skin microbiota bacterial strains in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), combining 16S RNA tagged-amplicon 454 pyrosequencing with genetic linkage analysis. Skin microbiota analysis revealed high inter-individual variation among 86 F2 fish progeny based upon the relative abundance of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Out of those OTUs, the pathogenic strain Flavobacterium psychrophilum and the non-pathogenic strain Methylobacterium rhodesianum explained the majority of inter-individual distances. Furthermore, a strong negative correlation was found between Flavobacterium and Methylobacterium , suggesting a mutually competitive relationship. Finally, after considering a total of 266 markers, genetic linkage analysis highlighted three major QTL associated with the abundance of Lysobacter, Rheinheimera and Methylobacterium. All these three genera are known for their beneficial antibacterial activity. Overall, our results provide evidence that host genotype may regulate the abundance of specific genera among their surface microbiota. They also indicate that Lysobacter, Rheinheimera and Methylobacterium are potentially important genera in providing protection against pathogens.  2014 Boutin et al.;MA209;CM;include;interspecific;parasite-host, bacteria-fish
Simple foraging rules in competitive environments can generate socially structured populations;Social vertebrates commonly form foraging groups whose members repeatedly interact with one another and are often genetically related. Many species also exhibit within-population specializations, which can range from preferences to forage in particular areas through to specializing on the type of prey they catch. However, within-population structure in foraging groups, behavioral homogeneity in foraging behavior, and relatedness could be outcomes of behavioral interactions rather than underlying drivers. We present a simple process by which grouping among foragers emerges and is maintained across generations. We introduce agent-based models to investigate (1) whether a simple rule (keep foraging with the same individuals when you were successful) leads to stable social community structure, and (2) whether this structure is robust to demographic changes and becomes kin-structured over time. We find the rapid emergence of kin-structured populations and the presence of foraging groups that control, or specialize on, a particular food resource. This pattern is strongest in small populations, mirroring empirical observations. Our results suggest that group stability can emerge as a product of network self-organization and, in doing so, may provide the necessary conditions for the evolution of more sophisticated processes, such as social learning. This taxonomically general social process has implications for our understanding of the links between population, genetic, and social structures.;MA323;CM;include;intraspecific;theoretical/modelling, group-stability
The oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi supports a Cretaceous diversification of fungal-arthropod symbioses;Paleoophiocordyceps coccophagus, a fungal parasite of a scale insect from the Early Cretaceous (Upper Albian), is reported and described here. This fossil not only provides the oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi but also contains morphological features similar to asexual states of Hirsutella and Hymenostilbe of the extant genus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). Because species of Hypocreales collectively exhibit a broad range of nutritional modes and symbioses involving plants, animals and other fungi, we conducted ancestral host reconstruction coupled with phylogenetic dating analyses calibrated with P. coccophagus. These results support a plant-based ancestral nutritional mode for Hypocreales, which then diversified ecologically through a dynamic process of intra- and interkingdom host shifts involving fungal, higher plant and animal hosts. This is especially evident in the families Cordycipitaceae, Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae, which are characterized by a high occurrence of insect pathogens. The ancestral ecologies of Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae are inferred to be animal pathogens, a trait inherited from a common ancestor, whereas the ancestral host affiliation of Cordycipitaceae was not resolved. Phylogenetic dating supports both a Jurassic origin of fungal-animal symbioses within Hypocreales and parallel diversification of all three insect pathogenic families during the Cretaceous, concurrent with the diversification of insects and angiosperms.

Spatial evolutionary dynamics produce a negative cooperation-population size relationship;Natural selection can favour cooperation, but it is unclear when cooperative populations should be larger than less cooperative ones. While experiments have shown that cooperation can increase population size, cooperation and population size can become negatively correlated if spatial processes affect both variables in opposite directions. We use a simple mathematical model of spatial common-pool resource production to investigate how space affects the cooperation-population size relationship. We find that only cooperation that is sufficiently beneficial to neighbours increases population size. However, spatial clustering variations can create a negative cooperation-population relationship between populations even when cooperation is highly beneficial, because clustering selects for cooperation but decreases population size. Individual-based simulations with variable individual movement rates produced variation in spatial clustering and the hypothesized negative cooperation-population relationships. These results suggest that variation in spatial clustering can limit the size of evolutionarily stable cooperating populations - an ecological dilemma of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A commentary on domestic animals as dual-purpose models that benefit agricultural and biomedical research;Research on domestic animals (cattle, swine, sheep, goats, poultry, horses, and aquatic species) at land grant institutions is integral to improving the global competitiveness of US animal agriculture and to resolving complex animal and human diseases. However, dwindling federal and state budgets, years of stagnant funding from USDA for the Competitive State Research, Education, and Extension Service National Research Initiative (CSREES-NRI) Competitive Grants Program, significant reductions in farm animal species and in numbers at land grant institutions, and declining enrollment for graduate studies in animal science are diminishing the resources necessary to conduct research on domestic species. Consequently, recruitment of scientists who use such models to conduct research relevant to animal agriculture and biomedicine at land grant institutions is in jeopardy. Concerned stakeholders have addressed this critical problem by conducting workshops, holding a series of meetings with USDA and National Institutes of Health (NIH) officials, and developing a white paper to propose solutions to obstacles impeding the use of domestic species as dual-purpose animal models for high-priority problems common to agriculture and biomedicine. In addition to shortfalls in research support and human resources, overwhelming use of mouse models in biomedicine, lack of advocacy from university administrators, long-standing cultural barriers between agriculture and human medicine, inadequate grantsmanship by animal scientists, and a scarcity of key reagents and resources are major roadblocks to progress. Solutions will require a large financial enhancement of USDA's Competitive Grants Program, educational programs geared toward explaining how research using agricultural animals benefits both animal agriculture and human health, and the development of a new mind-set in land grant institutions that fosters greater cooperation among basic and applied researchers. Recruitment of outstanding scientists dedicated to using domestic animal models for agricultural and biomedical research, strong incentives for scientists to take advantage of training opportunities to write NIH grants, and greater NIH and USDA cooperation to sponsor the use of agricultural animals as dual-purpose animal models that benefit agriculture and biomedicine will also be necessary. In conclusion, the broad diversity of animal models needed for agricultural and biomedical research is at risk unless research priorities at the land grant uni-versities are critically evaluated and financial support for such research is dramatically increased. 2008 American Society of Animal Science.

Does soil type drive social organization in southern hairy-nosed wombats?;"Spatiotemporal distributions of key resources are hypothesized to underpin sociobiological patterns. Burrow availability and quality is of paramount importance to fossorial animals. The southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows in both hard and friable soils. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the harder substrate should promote closer geographical clustering of burrows than in softer soils. Clustered burrows are expected to be associated with larger group sizes. If sociality is driven by constraint rather than advantage, patterns of spatial and temporal distribution of animals within and among groups may show indications of avoidance or even antagonism, and `making the best of a bad job' via positive kin associations to offset the disadvantages of high-density living. To test these ideas, we compared warren relatedness and social structure of L. latifrons on friable soils (Nullarbor Plain) and hard calcrete (Brookfield Conservation Park, BCP). Individuals were sampled by noninvasive collection of hairs for genotyping to identify individuals and to estimate their space-use and associative behaviour with respect to relatedness. Burrows in calcrete were indeed more clumped, and warren and group size larger. Differences in spatiotemporal organization and relatedness structure between sites were in the expected direction: (i) Nullarbor males associated and shared warrens less than at BCP; and (ii) Nullarbor spatial relatedness patterning data were not consistent with proposed female breeding dispersal, in contrast to those at BCP. Under Nullarbor (low density) conditions, cooperation or tolerance between males may be less advantageous, and accessing or digging burrows should be less of a constraint for juvenile females.";MA103;CM;include;intraspecific;cooperation-tolerance
Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control;Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive controla set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasksa Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figureseach with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.  2018 Khambhati et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.;MA356;CM;exclude;;
Coalitions destabilize dyadic dominance relationships in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus);Dyadic agonistic dominance relationships are thought to result from asymmetries in both intrinsic and extrinsic power. One form of extrinsic power is the ability to solicit agonistic support from other individuals. In extreme cases extrinsic power differences may override intrinsic power differences so that physically inferior individuals attain rank positions above stronger competitors. In other cases superior extrinsic power in physically inferior individuals may destabilize the otherwise clear dominance relationships. We tested this prediction with observational data on adult males in one of three free-ranging groups of Barbary macaques at Affenberg Salem, Germany. All prime males that were subjects of this study were at least 5-8 years (average 10 years) younger than the old post-prime males that were all subordinate to them. Assuming large age differences to reflect large intrinsic/physical power differences, interactions between these prime and the old males allowed investigation of the separate effects of intrinsic and extrinsic power asymmetries on dominance relationships. We estimated relationship instability using four different estimates (counter aggression, conflicts initiated by aggression from the subordinate, spontaneous submissions by dominants, and decided conflicts won by the subordinate). Relationship instability did not decrease with increasing asymmetry in intrinsic power. Instead, all four measures of relationship instability were positively related to the number of times the dominant in a dyad was target of destabilizing coalitions. Destabilizing coalitions targeted dominant males in old male-prime male dyads more often than in old male-old male dyads. Consequently, old males had less stable relationships with the much stronger prime males than with each other. We conclude that extrinsic power asymmetries predicted the instability of dyadic dominance relationships and may systematically override intrinsic power asymmetries.;MA48;CM;include;intraspecific;dominance, group stability
Crossing scales, crossing disciplines: Collective motion and collective action in the Global Commons;Two conflicting tendencies can be seen throughout the biological world: individuality and collective behaviour. Natural selection operates on differences among individuals, rewarding those who perform better. Nonetheless, even within this milieu, cooperation arises, and the repeated emergence of multicellularity is the most striking example. The same tendencies are played out at higher levels, as individuals cooperate in groups, which compete with other such groups. Many of our environmental and other global problems can be traced to such conflicts, and to the unwillingness of individual agents to take account of the greater good. One of the great challenges in achieving sustainability will be in understanding the basis of cooperation, and in taking multicellularity to yet a higher level, finding the pathways to the level of cooperation that is the only hope for the preservation of the planet.  2010 The Royal Society.;MA83;CM;exclude;;
Social network theory: new insights and issues for behavioral ecologists;"Until recently, few studies have used social network theory (SNT) and metrics to examine how social network structure (SNS) might influence social behavior and social dynamics in non-human animals. Here, we present an overview of why and how the social network approach might be useful for behavioral ecology. We first note four important aspects of SNS that are commonly observed, but relatively rarely quantified: (1) that within a social group, differences among individuals in their social experiences and connections affect individual and group outcomes; (2) that indirect connections can be important (e.g., partners of your partners matter); (3) that individuals differ in their importance in the social network (some can be considered keystone individuals); and (4) that social network traits often carry over across contexts (e.g., SN position in male-male competition can influence later male mating success). We then discuss how these four points, and the social network approach in general, can yield new insights and questions for a broad range of issues in behavioral ecology including: mate choice, alternative mating tactics, male-male competition, cooperation, reciprocal altruism, eavesdropping, kin selection, dominance hierarchies, social learning, information flow, social foraging, and cooperative antipredator behavior. Finally, we suggest future directions including: (1) integrating behavioral syndromes and SNT; (2) comparing space use and SNS; (3) adaptive partner choice and SNS; (4) the dynamics and stability (or instability) of social networks, and (5) group selection shaping SNS.";MA337;CM;include;intraspecific;theoretical/modelling, social networks
Within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts;Wolbachia is a widespread, intracellular symbiont of arthropods, able to induce reproductive distortions and antiviral protection in insects. Wolbachia can also be pathogenic, as is the case with wMelPop, a virulent variant of the endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. An extensive genomic amplification of the 20kb region encompassing eight Wolbachia genes, called Octomom, is responsible for wMelPop virulence. The Octomom copy number in wMelPop can be highly variable between individual D. melanogaster flies, even when comparing siblings arising from a single female. Moreover, Octomom copy number can change rapidly between generations. These data suggest an intra-host variability in Octomom copy number between Wolbachia cells. Since wMelPop Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability. Here we tested if total Octomom copy number changes during the lifespan of individual Drosophila hosts, revealing selection for different Wolbachia populations. We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number. We show that despite the Octomom copy number being relatively stable it increases slightly throughout D. melanogaster adult life. This indicates that there is selection acting on the intra-host variation in the Octomom copy number over the lifespan of individual hosts. This within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts may be in conflict with between host selection against highly pathogenic Wolbachia.  2018 Chrostek, Teixeira.

Eukarya associated with the stony coral Oculina patagonica from the Mediterranean Sea;Oculina patagonica is a putative alien scleractinian coral from the Southwest Atlantic that inhabits across the Mediterranean Sea. Here, we have addressed the diversity of Eukarya associated with this coral and its changes related to the environmental conditions and coral status. A total of 46 colonies of O. patagonica were taken from Alicante coast (Spain) and Pietra Ligure coast (Italy) and analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the small-subunit 18S rRNA and 16S plastid rRNA genes, internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2) analyses, and electron microscopy. Our results show that Eukarya and plastid community associated to O. patagonica change with environmental conditions and coral status. Cryptic species, which can be difficult to identify by optical methods, were distinguished by 18S rRNA gene DGGE: the barnacle Megatrema anglicum, which was detected at two locations, and two boring sponges related to Cliona sp. and Siphonodictyon coralliphagum detected in samples from Tabarca and Alicante Harbour, respectively. Eukaryotic phototrophic community from the skeletal matrix of healthy corals was dominated by Ochrosphaera sp. while bleached corals from the Harbour and Tabarca were associated to different uncultured phototrophic organism. Differences in ultrastructural morphologies of the zooxanthellae between healthy and bleached corals were observed. Nevertheless, no differences were found in Symbiodinium community among time, environments, coral status and location, showing that O. patagonica hosted only one genotype of Symbiodinium belonging to clade B2. The fact that this clade has not been previously detected in other Mediterranean corals and is more frequent in the tropical Western Atlantic, is a new evidence that O. patagonica is an alien species in the Mediterranean Sea.  2014 Elsevier B.V.;MA121;CM;exclude;;
State-dependent sentinels: an experimental study in the Arabian babbler;"Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers. Turdoides squamiceps have proven consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply hy individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately fed a supplement of mealworms each for one day at a time. Control days before and after each treatment confirmed that Ilo carry-over effects occurred, and that most normal sentinel activity was carried our by alpha males, then beta males and then by. the rest of the group. When supplemented. both alpha and beta males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity relative to control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences in individual bod! mass within groups reflected natural and experimental variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for an); increased interference between malts during the supplementation treatments. These results therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to cooperative sentinel behaviour.";MA352;CM;exclude;;
Lethal male-male combat in the parasitoid Melittobia acasta: are size and competitive environment important?;Interactions between organisms can lie anywhere along the spectrum from fatal conflict to total cooperation. To understand this variation, knowledge of the strategies that individuals use to acquire their resources is required. We tested theoretical predictions relating to conflict behaviour in a species of parasitoid wasp, Melittobia acasta, in which males compete for mates in their closed, natal patches. They engage in lethal combat to gain access to the females developing in their host. Environmental factors and individual traits both influenced conflict behaviour and contest outcome: fighting behaviour increased with the density of competitors and larger contestants were more successful.

Rapid viral symbiogenesis via changes in parasitoid wasp genome architecture;Viral genome integration provides a complex route to biological innovation that has rarely but repeatedly occurred in one of the most diverse lineages of organisms on the planet, parasitoid wasps. We describe a novel endogenous virus in braconid wasps derived from pathogenic alphanudiviruses. Limited to a subset of the genus Fopius, this recent acquisition allows an unprecedented opportunity to examine early endogenization events. Massive amounts of virus-like particles (VLPs) are produced in wasp ovaries. Unlike most endogenous viruses of parasitoid wasps, the VLPs do not contain DNA, translating to major differences in parasitism-promoting strategies. Rapid changes include genomic rearrangement, loss of DNA processing proteins, and wasp control of viral gene expression. These events precede the full development of tissue-specific viral gene expression observed in older associations. These data indicate that viral endogenization can rapidly result in functional and evolutionary changes associated with genomic novelty and adaptation in parasitoids.  The Author(s) 2018.

Evolution of culture-dependent discriminate sociality: A gene-culture coevolutionary model;"Animals behave cooperatively towards certain conspecifics while being indifferent or even hostile to others. The distinction is made primarily according to kinship as predicted by the kin selection theory. With regards to humans, however, this is not always the case; in particular, humans sometimes exhibit a discriminate sociality on the basis of culturally transmitted traits, such as personal ornaments, languages, rituals, etc. This paper explores the possibility that the human faculty of cultural transmission and resultant cultural variation among individuals may have facilitated the evolution of discriminate sociality in humans. To this end, a gene-culture coevolutionary model is developed focusing on competition over control of resource as a context in which discriminate sociality may have evolved. Specifically, two types of culture-dependent discriminate sociality are considered: ingroup favouritism, with ingroup and outgroup being distinguished by the presence or absence of a cultural trait; and prestige hierarchies, with the prestige being conferred on the bearer of a cultural trait. The model specifies the conditions under which emergence and evolutionary stability of the two types of discriminate sociality are promoted by the presence of cultural variation among individuals.  2011 The Royal Society.";MA124;CM;include;intraspecific;"theoretical/modelling; discriminate sociality"
Collaboration among sponge species increases sponge diversity and abundance in a seagrass meadow;Caribbean sponge species typical of coral reefs are generally inhibited from living in seagrass meadows by their vulnerability to predation by the large starfish Oreaster reticulatus (Linnaeus 1758). Although readily consumed by Oreaster, the conspicuous coral reef sponge species Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea & van Soest, 1986 has expanded its habitat distribution to include a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Knig, 1805) meadow in Belize, where individuals grow to volumes of nearly 7l. By simple observation, L. colombiensis appears to be an inferior competitor in this system, because portions of many individuals are overgrown by seagrass sponge species. However, experimentally clustering seagrass sponges around L. colombiensis individuals deterred starfish from feeding on them, suggesting an advantage to being overgrown. Sizes of individual L. colombiensis can fluctuate widely over short time intervals, reflecting both a relatively fast growth rate and the high rate at which starfish consume this species. At the population level these fluctuations are not evident, as losses of L. colombiensis due to Oreaster are balanced by a combination of efficient recruitment, rapid regeneration and growth, and protection of portions of many individuals by the overgrowth of seagrass sponge species that are unpalatable to Oreaster . In turn, the seagrass sponges acquire stable perches on L. colombiensis individuals in this sediment-dominated habitat. Community ecology theory relating to diversity patterns in sessile organisms has focused on competition between space-requiring neighbors as the underlying process that inevitably decreases diversity unless curtailed. Sponges, with their propensity for engaging in beneficial interactions with neighbors, demand expansion of the theory to acknowledge how collaboration can increase abundance and species diversity within a community.

Nuclear and genome dynamics in multinucleate ascomycete fungi;Genetic variation between individuals is essential to evolution and adaptation. However, intra-organismic genetic variation also shapes the life histories of many organisms, including filamentous fungi. A single fungal syncytium can harbor thousands or millions of mobile and potentially genotypically different nuclei, each having the capacity to regenerate a new organism. Because the dispersal of asexual or sexual spores propagates individual nuclei in many of these species, selection acting at the level of nuclei creates the potential for competitive and cooperative genome dynamics. Recent work in Neurospora crassa and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has illuminated how nuclear populations are coordinated for fungal growth and other behaviors and has revealed both molecular and physical mechanisms for preventing and policing inter-genomic conflict. Recent results from population-level genomic studies in a variety of filamentous fungi suggest that nuclear exchange between mycelia and recombination between heterospecific nuclei may be of more importance to fungal evolution, diversity and the emergence of newly virulent strains than has previously been recognized.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Geography has a greater effect than Wolbachia infection on population genetic structure in the spider mite, Tetranychus pueraricola;Wolbachia is an intracellular symbiotic bacterium that infects various spider mite species and is associated with alterations in host reproduction, which indicates the potential role in mite evolution. However, studies of Wolbachia infections in the spider mite Tetranychus pueraricola, a major agricultural pest, are limited. Here, we used multilocus sequence typing to determine Wolbachia infection status and examined the relationship between Wolbachia infection status and mitochondrial diversity in T. pueraricola from 12 populations in China. The prevalence of Wolbachia ranged from 2.8 to 50%, and three strains (wTpue1, wTpue2, and wTpue3) were identified. We also found double infections (wTpue1 + wTpue3) within the same individuals. Furthermore, the wTpue1 strain caused weak cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) (egg hatchability ~55%), whereas another widespread strain, wTpue3, did not induce CI. There was no reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA diversity among infected individuals, and mtDNA haplotypes did not correspond to specific Wolbachia strains. Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed that the distribution of mtDNA and nuclear DNA haplotypes were significantly associated with geography. These findings indicate that Wolbachia infection in T. pueraricola is complex, but T. pueraricola genetic differentiation likely resulted from substantial geographic isolation.

Plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran desert: Current knowledge and future research perspectives;Premise of research. Biotic interactions have long been considered to be of less importance in structuring desert systems than other ecosystem types, but biotic interactions often play a critical role in meeting the challenges posed by the extreme conditions of desert environments. The Sonoran Desert, in particular, is home to several textbook examples of mutualisms, such as the interactions between the iconic saguaro cactus and its bat pollinators. But what do we know about the diversity, ecology, and evolution of plant-animal, plant-plant, and plant-microbe interactions and their impacts on individual plants and plant species in the Sonoran Desert? Methodology. To address this question, we review the published research on seven common kinds of plant biotic interactions by revisiting the respective literature, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and outlining future research directions. Pivotal results. Numerous gaps in our knowledge of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert were identified. Studies of insect herbivory, bee pollination, and plant-microbe interactions are poorly represented in the Sonoran Desert literature. Across all categories of interaction, few have examined the impacts of interactions on plant fitness or context-dependent variation in the outcomes and strengths of interactions. For the most part, interactions have been studied at single locations and over short periods of time, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their diversity, ecology, and evolution. Conclusions. Plant biotic interactions shape the habitats in which they occur and play an important role in the maintenance of species diversity. Therefore, we call for increased efforts to fill the gaps in our understanding of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert, with an emphasis on studies linking interactions to plant fitness and the context-dependent nature of interactions. Without this knowledge we have limited capacity to predict the outcomes of global change on species interactions and to develop measures to conserve the biodiversity of the Sonoran Desert region.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

Diversity of algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae) in octocorals: The roles of geography and host relationships;The presence, genetic identity and diversity of algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) in 114 species from 69 genera (20 families) of octocorals from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the far eastern Pacific (EP) and the Caribbean was examined, and patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis were compared with patterns in the host phylogeny. Genetic analyses of the zooxanthellae were based on ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. In the GBR samples, Symbiodinium clades A and G were encountered with A and G being rare. Clade B zooxanthellae have been previously reported from a GBR octocoral, but are also rare in octocorals from this region. Symbiodinium G has so far only been found in Foraminifera, but is rare in these organisms. In the Caribbean samples, only Symbiodinium clades B and C are present. Hence, Symbiodinium diversity at the level of phylogenetic clades is lower in octocorals from the Caribbean compared to those from the GBR. However, an unprecedented level of ITS1 diversity was observed within individual colonies of some Caribbean gorgonians, implying either that these simultaneously harbour multiple strains of clade B zooxanthellae, or that ITS1 heterogeneity exists within the genomes of some zooxanthellae. Intracladal diversity based on ITS should therefore be interpreted with caution, especially in cases where no independent evidence exists to support distinctiveness, such as ecological distribution or physiological characteristics. All samples from EP are azooxanthellate. Three unrelated GBR taxa that are described in the literature as azooxanthellate (Junceella fragilis, Euplexaura nuttingi and Stereonephthya sp. 1) contain clade G zooxanthellae, and their symbiotic association with zooxanthellae was confirmed by histology. These corals are pale in colour, whereas related azooxanthellate species are brightly coloured. The evolutionary loss or gain of zooxanthellae may have altered the light sensitivity of the host tissues, requiring the animals to adopt or reduce pigmentation. Finally, we superimposed patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis onto a molecular phylogeny of the host. The data show that many losses/gains of endosymbiosis have occurred during the evolution of octocorals. The ancestral state (azooxanthellate or zooxanthellate) in octocorals remains unclear, but the data suggest that on an evolutionary timescale octocorals can switch more easily between mixotrophy and heterotrophy compared to scleractinian corals, which coincides with a low reliance on photosynthetic carbon gain in the former group of organisms.  2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;MA96;CM;exclude;;
Agrobiodiversity;Agrobiodiversity refers to the variety and variability of living organisms that contribute to food and agriculture in the broadest sense, and that are associated with cultivating crops and rearing animals within ecological complexes. It is further expanded in some contexts to include all the organisms present in an agricultural landscape. Examples consist of crops and animal breeds, their wild relatives, and the species that interact with and support these species, for example, pollinators, symbionts, pests, parasites, predators, decomposers, and competitors. Croplands and fields as well as habitats and species outside of farming systems that affect agriculture and ecosystem functions in agricultural landscape are included. Agrobiodiversity can also refer to the extraction and utilization of products from natural ecosystems such as nonforest timber products, or livestock that pasture in grasslands. Utilization and conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is strongly influenced by socioeconomic factors at local, regional, and global scales. The concepts of agrobiodiversity are also valid for forestry and fisheries, especially in situations where human activities dominate the ecosystem processes.  2013 Elsevier Inc.

Mining the Plasmodium genome database to define organellar function: What does the apicoplast do?;Apicomplexan species constitute a diverse group of parasitic protozoa, which are responsible for a wide range of diseases in many organisms. Despite differences in the diseases they cause, these parasites share an underlying biology, from the genetic controls used to differentiate through the complex parasite life cycle, to the basic biochemical pathways employed for intracellular survival, to the distinctive cell biology necessary for host cell attachment and invasion. Different parasites lend themselves to the study of different aspects of parasite biology: Eimeria for biochemical studies, Toxoplasma for molecular genetic and cell biological investigation, etc. The Plasmodium falciparum Genome Project contributes the first large-scale genomic sequence for an apicomplexan parasite. The Plasmodium Genome Database (http://PlasmoDB. org) has been designed to permit individual investigators to ask their own questions, even prior to formal release of the reference P. falciparum genome sequence. As a case in point, PlasmoDB has been exploited to identify metabolic pathways associated with the apicomplexan plastid, or 'apicoplast'- an essential organelle derived by secondary endosymbiosis of an alga, and retention of the algal plastid.;MA244;CM;exclude;;
Pattern of individual participation and cheating in conflicts between groups of free-ranging dogs;Cooperative intergroup aggression provides an example of a costly cooperative behaviour whose benefits spill over to noncooperative animals as well. Consequently, investigating factors that promote individual participation in intergroup contests should prove useful for understanding how cooperation may persist in animal societies despite cheating. Here, we examined variables affecting individual participation in naturally occurring conflicts between groups of free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris. The overall proportion of cooperating group members decreased significantly with an increasing number of group members present. In one pack, the individual probability of active participation decreased significantly when this pack had a numerical advantage over opponents. Dogs belonging to the smallest pack tended to be more cooperative than those belonging to larger groups. Social prestige ( measured as the number of submissions received during greeting) did not appear to be a consequence of cooperative behaviour. Individual participation increased with an increasing number of affiliative partners. Young and high-ranking dogs tended to cooperate more when their group was outnumbered by opponents but did not stay at the front of the pack during conflicts. These results emphasize the greater opportunity for cheating in larger groups and the complexity of dogs' behaviour. Cooperation appears to be conditional on both the `adversity of the environment' (as measured by relative group size) and the identity/behaviour of companions.

Hormonal underpinnings of status conflict: Testosterone and cortisol are related to decisions and satisfaction in the hawk-dove game;A contribution to a special issue on Hormones and Human Competition. Testosterone is theorized to influence status-seeking behaviors such as social dominance and competitive behavior, but supporting evidence is mixed. The present study tested the roles of testosterone and cortisol in the hawk dove game, a dyadic economic decision-making paradigm in which earnings depend on one's own and the other player's choices. If one person selects the hawk strategy and the other person selects the dove strategy, the player who selected hawk attains a greater financial pay-off (status differentiation). The worst financial outcome occurs when both players choose the hawk strategy (status confrontation). Ninety-eight undergraduate students (42 men) provided saliva samples and played ten rounds of the hawk-dove game with another same-sex participant. In support of the hypothesis that testosterone is related to status concern, individuals higher in basal testosterone made more hawk decisions decisions that harmed the other player. Acute decreases in cortisol were also associated with more hawk decisions. There was some empirical support for the dual-hormone hypothesis as well: basal testosterone was positively related to satisfaction in the game among low basal-cortisol individuals but not among high basal-cortisol individuals. There were no significant sex differences in these hormonal effects. The present findings align with theories of hormones and status-seeking behavior at the individual level, but they also open up new avenues for research on hormone profiles at the collective level. Our results suggest that the presence of two or more high-testosterone members increases the likelihood of status confrontations over a limited resource that can undermine collective outcomes.

Variation in individual investment strategies among social animals;Cooperation and conflict are ubiquitous features of life in the vast majority of animals and can occur over a wide range of functional contents and at various levels. In this review I describe known and less well-known proximate aspects of cooperation and conflict over reproductive behaviour in social animals, where individuals other than the genetic parents contribute to the provisioning of care ('alloparental care'). Traditionally the evolution of alloparental care is viewed as a two-step process: the decision to delay dispersal and independent breeding, usually as a consequence of the existence of constraints on independent breeding, and the decision to behave as alloparents by which individuals that have delayed dispersal gain a net fitness benefit. Behavioural ecological theory generally assumes that all individuals are similar in 'make-up' and that life history and behavioural decisions are facultative. However, there is probably more individual variation in the amount and type of social behaviour than originally anticipated. Here, I demonstrate that some of these differences in behaviours are because of environmental factors, which may be associated with 'reaction norms' or the genotype's quantitative phenotypic variation, or which may yield polyethisms. Most evolutionary models of animal cooperation are based on optimality approaches that do not consider individual genetic variation and maternal effects on the variation in the expression of social behaviour. Further research on the genetic basis of cooperations and subordinate-breeder interactions may be crucial for understanding the evolution of social behaviour. If we take individual differences into account our conclusions and explanations of social behaviour may change. Given the conceptual similarities between the various research disciplines addressing different types of cooperation and conflict over investment, the issues described here should lead to more mutual attraction between the different disciplines and stimulate further development in our understanding of cooperation strategies in general.  2006 The Author.;MA405;CM;include;intraspecific;review, cooperation, conflict
Ecological characteristics of insects that affect symbiotic relationships with mites;Parasites and pathogens that begin as symbionts, i.e., organisms living together in the same habitat, are some of the most promising drivers of species evolution. Because insects are highly diverse and important as ecosystem service agents and because mites can exert large effects on insect populations (capable of killing at least juveniles), insect-mite interactions have been analyzed from various perspectives, including evolutionary, ecological and pest-management perspectives. Here, I review and examine insect-mite symbiotic associations to develop hypotheses concerning the factors that maintain and develop their relationships. Previous studies have hypothesized that insect sociality and mite richness and specificity affect insect-mite interactions. I found that both solitary and social insects, including parasocial and subsocial insects, harbor numbers of symbionts including species-specific ones but few dangerous mite symbionts in their nests or habitats under natural conditions. Nest size or the amount of food resources in a nest may affect mite richness. On the basis of this review, I hypothesize that the insect characteristics relevant for mite symbiotic hosting are sharing the same habitat with mites and living in a nutrient-rich habitat. I also suggest that many cases of species-specific symbiosis began with phoresy. To test these hypotheses, phylogenetic information on mites living with insect groups and quantitative analysis to characterize each insect-mite relationship are necessary.  2013 The Entomological Society of Japan.;MA110;CM;include;interspecific;review, insect-mite relationships, host-symbiont
Revealing microparasite diversity in aquatic environments using brute force molecular techniques and subtle microscopy;Aquatic ecosystems (seas, oceans, rivers and lakes) cover >70% of the Earth's surface and play essential roles in geochemical cycling and climate regulation. They are also hugely important for human health, nutrition and economy, providing drinking water, food, transport and leisure resources. These environments harbour complex and cryptic ecosystems dominated in terms of abundance and biomass by planktonic microbes including bacteria, archaea, viruses and eukaryotic organisms (such as protists and fungi). These organisms form numerous and diverse interactions encompassing all kind of exchanges, e.g. predatorprey relationships and all shades of symbiosis from commensalism to parasitism.

Cooperation in humans: competition between groups and proximate emotions;Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that favour cooperation remains one of the greatest challenges in the biological and social sciences. A number of theoretical studies have suggested that competition between groups may have played a key role in the evolution of cooperation within human societies, and similar ideas have been discussed for other organisms, especially cooperative breeding vertebrates. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing these ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans, that when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards, individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and those of their group mates. Overall, our results arc consistent with the idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Decomposer diversity and identity influence plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning;"Plant productivity and other ecosystem functions often increase with plant diversity at a local scale. Alongside various plant-centered explanations for this pattern, there is accumulating evidence that multi-trophic interactions shape this relationship. Here, we investigated for the first time if plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are mediated or driven by decomposer animal diversity and identity using a double-diversity microcosm experiment. We show that many ecosystem processes and ecosystem multifunctionality (herbaceous shoot biomass production, litter removal, and N uptake) were affected by both plant and decomposer diversity, with ecosystem process rates often being maximal at intermediate to high plant and decomposer diversity and minimal at both low plant and decomposer diversity. Decomposers relaxed interspecific plant competition by enlarging chemical (increased N uptake and surface-litter decomposition) and spatial (increasing deep-root biomass) habitat space and by promoting plant complementarity. Anecic earthworms and isopods functioned as key decomposers; although decomposer diversity effects did not solely rely on these two decomposer species, positive plant net biodiversity and complementarity effects only occurred in the absence of isopods and the presence of anecic earthworms. Using a structural equation model, we explained 76\% of the variance in plant complementarity, identified direct and indirect effect paths, and showed that the presence of key decomposers accounted for approximately three-quarters of the explained variance. We conclude that decomposer animals have been underappreciated as contributing agents of plant diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Elevated decomposer performance at high plant diversity found in previous experiments likely positively feeds back to plant performance, thus contributing to the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.";MA87;CM;exclude;;
Spatial consequences for dolphins specialized in foraging with fishermen;"According to theory, individuals forage in ways that maximize net energy intake. Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human-animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition.

Aphid-encoded variability in susceptibility to a parasitoid;"Background: Many animals exhibit variation in resistance to specific natural enemies. Such variation may be encoded in their genomes or derived from infection with protective symbionts. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, for example, exhibits tremendous variation in susceptibility to a common natural enemy, the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi. Pea aphids are often infected with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, which confers partial to complete resistance against this parasitoid depending on bacterial strain and associated bacteriophages. That previous studies found that pea aphids without H. defensa (or other symbionts) were generally susceptible to parasitism, together with observations of a limited encapsulation response, suggested that pea aphids largely rely on infection with H. defensa for protection against parasitoids. However, the limited number of uninfected clones previously examined, and our recent report of two symbiont-free resistant clones, led us to explicitly examine aphid-encoded variability in resistance to parasitoids. Results: After rigorous screening for known and unknown symbionts, and microsatellite genotyping to confirm clonal identity, we conducted parasitism assays using fifteen clonal pea aphid lines. We recovered significant variability in aphid-encoded resistance, with variation levels comparable to that contributed by H. defensa. Because resistance can be costly, we also measured aphid longevity and cumulative fecundity of the most and least resistant aphid lines under permissive conditions, but found no trade-offs between higher resistance and these fitness parameters. Conclusions: These results indicate that pea aphid resistance to A. ervi is more complex than previously appreciated, and that aphids employ multiple tactics to aid in their defense. While we did not detect a tradeoff, these may become apparent under stressful conditions or when resistant and susceptible aphids are in direct competition. Understanding sources and amounts of variation in resistance to natural enemies is necessary to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic interactions, such as the potential for coevolution, but also for the successful management of pest populations through biological control.  2014 Martinez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.";MA22;CM;include;interspecific;host-parasite
The bitterling-mussel interaction as a test case for co-evolution;The European bitterling Rhodeus sericeus (Cyprinidae) spawns in the gills of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) and shows some obvious adaptations to this type of spawning, such as the development of an ovipositor. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the fish avoid species of mussels that have a high likelihood of ejecting their eggs prematurely. This leads to the question of whether the interaction between bitterling and mussels could represent a case of co-evolution, involving evolutionary responses by both species to selection imposed by the other. The evidence for and against co-evolution is reviewed, incorporating new results from two sets of experiments designed to test for adaptive choices by bitterling according to the mussels' sex and reproductive state, as well as a preliminary study of potential benefits for mussels from exposure to bitterling. Host preferences by bitterling, both among and within mussel species, may indeed have evolved in response to differences in benefits for offspring survival. There is no evidence yet for any benefits to mussels from receiving eggs, whereas there are costs due to reduced ventilation rates when the gills contain bitterling eggs. While there are differences among mussel species and individuals in their tendency to reject bitterling embryos, these differences do not provide strong evidence for co-evolution. For example, they may reflect differences in host physiology such as ventilation rate and generalized responses to expelling objects from their gills. Therefore, while bitterling are well adapted for their obligate spawning relationship with mussels, it has been much more difficult to find evidence for adaptations by mussels for dealing with bitterling. This suggests that any co-evolutionary dynamics between bitterling and mussels may be asymmetric, with stronger responses to selection by the fish than by mussels.  2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;MA364;CM;exclude;;
Deciphering the Interdependence between Ecological and Evolutionary Networks;Biological systems consist of elements that interact within and across hierarchical levels. For example, interactions among genes determine traits of individuals, competitive and cooperative interactions among individuals influence population dynamics, and interactions among species affect the dynamics of communities and ecosystem processes. Such systems can be represented as hierarchical networks, but can have complex dynamics when interdependencies among levels of the hierarchy occur. We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary processes in hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological systems. We connect gene networks underlying predator-prey trait distributions to food webs. Our approach addresses longstanding questions about how complex traits and intraspecific trait variation affect the interdependencies among biological levels and the stability of meta-ecosystems.;MA86;CM;exclude;;
Genetic evidence confirms polygamous mating system in a crustacean parasite with multiple hosts;Mating systems are diverse in animals, notably in crustaceans, but can be inferred from a limited set of parameters. Baeza and Thiel (2007) proposed a model predicting mating systems of symbiotic crustaceans with three host characteristics and the risk of predation. These authors proposed five mating systems, ranging from monogamy to polygynandry (where multiple mating occurs for both genders). Using microsatellite loci, we tested the putatively mating system of the ectoparasite crab Dissodactylus primitivus. We determined the mating frequencies of males and females, parentage assignment (COLONY &GERUD software) as well as the contents of female spermathecae. Our results are globally consistent with the model of Baeza and Thiel and showed, together with previous aquarium experiments, that this ectoparasite evolved a polygamous mating system where males and females move between hosts for mate search. Parentage analyses revealed that polyandry is frequent and concerns more than 60% of clutches, with clutches being fertilized by up to 6 different fathers. Polygyny is supported by the detection of eight males having sired two different broods. We also detected a significant paternity skew in 92% of the multipaternal broods. Moreover, this skew is probably higher than the estimation from the brood because additional alleles were detected in most of spermathecae. This high skew could be explained by several factors as sperm competition or cryptic female choice. Our genetic data, combined with previous anatomic analyses, provide consistent arguments to suggest sperm precedence in D. primitivus.  2014 Jossart et al.;MA165;CM;exclude;;
Sexual cooperation relies on food controlled by females in agromyzid flies;A sex difference in mating optima generates antagonistic traits that impose costs on the opposite sex. This conflict can be mediated by food that increases mutual benefits. Although current understanding of sexual cooperation involving food is based exclusively on mating systems with male food control, recent studies have suggested universal female food control across taxa. However, there have been no empirical studies testing food's role in facilitating sexual cooperation in this scenario. Here, we examined the interplay of food availability and mating in the pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, the males of which feed on the exudates from the leaf punctures created by female ovipositors. Given the association between female oviposition and food production, we infer that food controlled by females may alter male optima in mating and thus modulate male courtship strategies for mating. Mating stimulated females to produce abundant punctures, which benefited male feeding and survival. When males were deprived of the punctures, they adopted an elaborate dancing behaviour, leading to increased receptivity of females. However, when males adopted an alternative strategy of directly approaching females, they obtained fewer punctures. After preferential mating with dancing males, females significantly prolonged their life span and increased offspring numbers. Sexual cooperation in leafminers can be explained by the nutritional composition of plant exudates, which we found contain abundant sugars and amino acids. The plant exudates are vital food for males, but their nutritional value and availability rapidly declined with time. Our study reveals that the food produced by females can provide mutual benefits to male survival and female reproduction. Our study of food control by females extends our understanding of evolution in sexual cooperation.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour;MA321;CM;include;intraspecific;male-female, sexual cooperation
Synthesizing perspectives on the evolution of cooperation within and between species;Cooperation is widespread both within and between species, but are intraspecific and interspecific cooperation fundamentally similar or qualitatively different phenomena? This review evaluates this question, necessary for a general understanding of the evolution of cooperation. First, we outline three advantages of cooperation relative to noncooperation (acquisition of otherwise inaccessible goods and services, more efficient acquisition of resources, and buffering against variability), and predict when individuals should cooperate with a conspecific versus a heterospecific partner to obtain these advantages. Second, we highlight five axes along which heterospecific and conspecific partners may differ: relatedness and fitness feedbacks, competition and resource use, resource-generation abilities, relative evolutionary rates, and asymmetric strategy sets and outside options. Along all of these axes, certain asymmetries between partners are more common in, but not exclusive to, cooperation between species, especially complementary resource use and production. We conclude that cooperation within and between species share many fundamental qualities, and that differences between the two systems are explained by the various asymmetries between partners. Consideration of the parallels between intra- and interspecific cooperation facilitates application of well-studied topics in one system to the other, such as direct benefits within species and kin-selected cooperation between species, generating promising directions for future research.  2017 The Author(s).

Does prey mobility affect niche width and individual specialization in hunting wasps? A network-based analysis;Niche width and inter-individual diet variation in predator populations are known to be affected by intrinsic factors such as body size, age, cognitive constraints, and by intra- and interspecific competition. By contrast, how variation in prey biological traits may affect niche width and partitioning is still a poorly explored topic. One of these candidate traits is prey mobility, which can affect the predators' niche because acting on the rate of encounter and, assuming mobility as a proxy for escape capability, on the success of predator attacks. Here we analysed 20 wasp populations and their prey as individual-based food-webs to test if prey mobility may explain niche width (here defined by the Shannon entropy-based index ) and patterns of inter-individual diet variation (here defined by the interaction-exclusiveness index H2 and the interaction evenness index E2). Niche width was very variable among populations and overall network specialization (H2) was always higher than the expected by null models. In case of high-speed flying prey (e.g. flies, bees), wasps showed wider niches () and lower specialization (H2) than in case of non-flying or slow-flying prey (e.g. spiders, beetles). Evenness (E2), on the other side, did not vary with prey mobility. Altogether, these results suggest that highly elusive prey may lead to wider predators' niche but somehow limit their individual niche specialization.;MA102;CM;exclude;;
The extended personality: indirect effects of behavioural syndromes on the behaviour of others in a group-living cichlid;"Consistent individual variation in behaviour is widespread across taxa and behavioural categories. Because social behaviour is often a plastic response to the social environment, consistent variation in social behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group. In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social environment and may be an important selective influence on social behaviour and on variation among social groups.

The evolution of cooperation by negotiation in a noisy world;Cooperative interactions among individuals are ubiquitous despite the possibility of exploitation by selfish free riders. One mechanism that may promote cooperation is negotiation': individuals altering their behaviour in response to the behaviour of others. Negotiating individuals decide their actions through a recursive process of reciprocal observation, thereby reducing the possibility of free riding. Evolutionary games with response rules have shown that infinitely many forms of the rule can be evolutionarily stable simultaneously, unless there is variation in individual quality. This potentially restricts the conditions under which negotiation could maintain cooperation. Organisms interact with one another in a noisy world in which cooperative effort and the assessment of effort may be subject to error. Here, we show that such noise can make the number of evolutionarily stable rules finite, even without quality variation, and so noise could help maintain cooperative behaviour. We show that the curvature of the benefit function is the key factor determining whether individuals invest more or less as their partner's investment increases, investing less when the benefit to investment has diminishing returns. If the benefits of low investment are very small then behavioural flexibility tends to promote cooperation, because negotiation enables cooperators to reach large benefits. Under some conditions, this leads to a repeating cycle in which cooperative behaviour rises and falls over time, which may explain between-population differences in cooperative behaviour. In other conditions, negotiation leads to extremely high levels of cooperative behaviour, suggesting that behavioural flexibility could facilitate the evolution of eusociality in the absence of high relatedness.;MA372;CM;include;intraspecific;theoretical/modelling, cooperation
Caterpillar seed predators mediate shifts in selection on flowering phenology in their host plant;Variation in selection among populations and years has important implications for evolutionary trajectories of populations. Yet, the agents of selection causing this variation have rarely been identified. Selection on the time of reproduction within a season in plants might differ both among populations and among years, and selection can be mediated by both mutualists and antagonists. We investigated if differences in the direction of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology among 20 populations of Gentiana pneumonanthe during 2 yr were related to the presence of the butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon, and if butterfly incidence was associated with the abundance of the butterfly's second host, Myrmica ants. In plant populations without the butterfly, phenotypic selection favored earlier flowering. In populations where the butterfly was present, caterpillars preferentially attacked early-flowering individuals, shifting the direction of selection to favoring later flowering. Butterfly incidence in plant populations increased with ant abundance. Our results demonstrate that antagonistic interactions can shift the direction of selection on flowering phenology, and suggest that such shifts might be associated with differences in the community context.;MA41;CM;include;interspecific;plant-mutualist/antagonist interactions
Forest pathogens: Friend or foe to biodiversity?;Biological diversity in forest ecosystems results from evolutionary processes driven by ecological imperatives linked to pathogens, symbionts, fire, climate, and competition or impacts from other agents of disturbance. To understand the behavior of microorganisms and microbial pathogens, it is necessary to have a comprehensive appreciation for the diversity of their functional attributes in their natural habitats. Where niches are complex, evolution is guided by more than simple host-pathogen relationships. Moreover, the negative attributes of a pathosystem are not always obvious at different scales or in different contexts. Deleterious impacts on one species (e.g., mortality, parasitism) may benefit another species through reduced competition or enhanced nutrient cycling. Species with pathogenic behavior also display mutualistic and symbiotic benefits (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi and endophytic antagonists found in grasses) or useful attributes as biological control agents. Preserving the diversity of natural areas while controlling forest pests is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to understand pest niches more thoroughly, while the opportunity is to have a wiser use of both timber and nontimber forest resources.;MA154;CM;exclude;;
A control process model of code-switching;Code-switching (CS) is central to many bilingual communities and, though linguistic and sociolinguistic research has characterised different types of code-switches (alternations, insertions, dense CS), the cognitive control processes (CPs) that mediate them are not well understood. A key issue is how during CS speakers produce the right words in the right order. In speech, serial order emerges from a speech plan in which items are represented in parallel. We propose that entry into the mechanism for speech planning (a competitive queuing mechanism) is governed by CPs best suited to the particular types of code-switches. Language task schemas external to the language network govern access. In CS, they are coordinated cooperatively and operate in a coupled or in an open control mode. The former permits alternations and insertions whereas the latter is required for dense CS. We explore predictions of this CP model and its implications for CS research.;MA3;CM;exclude;;
Information use and resource competition: An integrative framework;Organisms may reduce uncertainty regarding how best to exploit their environment by collecting information about resource distribution. We develop a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individuals ability to use information when acquiring resources. As resource distribution underpins both selection on information use and the strength and nature of competition between individuals, we demonstrate interdependencies between the two that should be common in nature. Individuals in our model can search for resources either personally or by using social information. We explore selection on social information use across a comprehensive range of ecological conditions, generalizing the producerscrounger framework to a wide diversity of taxa and resources. We show that resource ecologydefined by scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizabilitydetermines patterns of individual differences in social information use. These differences suggest coevolutionary processes linking dominance systems and social information use, with implications for the evolutionary demography of populations.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Personality and intelligence: Persistence, not self-directedness, cooperativeness or self-transcendence, is related to twins' cognitive abilities;Background. A person-centered approach focusing on the interaction of an individual's temperament-character-life events is essential in the path of individuals' well-being. In this context, three character traits, Self-directedness (e.g., self-acceptance, self-control, goal-directed behavior), Cooperativeness (e.g., social affiliation, social tolerance, empathy and helpfulness) and Self-transcendence (e.g., spiritual acceptance, transpersonal identification), measured using Cloninger's model of personality are suggested to help the individual to regulate and resolve the conflicts derived from her/his temperament combinations as a reaction to life events. However, if character is related to the individual's cognitive ability, then this association might limit any intervention that focuses on character development. We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) to investigate the relationship between personality and cognitive ability. Method. The sample consisted of 370 15-year-old twins (159 girls/211 boys), 192 of whomscreen-positive with various types of mental health problems. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to measure personality and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV) to measure intelligence. The relationship was investigated using correlation analyses using random-selected twins from each dyad and separately for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Additional analyses investigated the genetic and environmental effects on personality and cognitive ability in this specific sample. Results. There were no significant correlations between the WISC-IV indices and any of the character traits (i.e., Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence). Persistence was significantly related, if weak, to four WISC-IV indices: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and the Full WISC-IV Scale. Post-hoc cross-twin/cross-trait analyses showed that the Persistence-cognitive ability correlation might depend on common genetic effects. The WISC-IV indices showed a relatively large genetic influence, while earlier findings about the etiology of temperament and character traits using the whole CATSS sample were replicated in this sub-sample of twins. Conclusions. The results indicate that what individuals make of themselves intentionally (i.e., their character) was not associated to intelligence. Persistence, a temperament dimension that measures heritable individual differences in eagerness of effort, ambition, perfectionism, and resistance to discouragement despite frustration and fatigue, was weakly linked to intelligence. Suggesting that, at least during adolescence, interventions targeting character development are not limited by the individual's intelligence.  2015 Mousavi et al.;MA276;CM;exclude;;
Climate Change and Phenological Mismatch in Trophic Interactions Among Plants, Insects, and Vertebrates;Phenological mismatch results when interacting species change the timing of regularly repeated phases in their life cycles at different rates. We review whether this continuously ongoing phenomenon, also known as trophic asynchrony, is becoming morecommonunder ongoing rapid climate change. In antagonistic trophic interactions, any mismatch will have negative impacts for only one of the species, whereas in mutualistic interactions, both partners are expected to suffer. Trophic mismatch is therefore expected to last for evolutionarily short periods, perhaps only a few seasons, adding to the difficulty of attributing it to climate change, which requires long-term data. So far, the prediction that diverging phenologies linked to climate change will cause mismatch is most clearly met in antagonistic interactions at high latitudes in the Artic. There is limited evidence of phenological mismatch in mutualistic interactions, possibly because of strong selection on mutualists to have co-adapted phenological strategies. The study of individual plasticity, population variation, and the genetic bases for phenological strategies is in its infancy. Recent work on woody plants revealed the large imprint of historic climate change on temperature, chilling, and day-length thresholds used by different species to synchronize their phenophases, which in the Northern Hemisphere has led to biogeographic phenological regions inwhich long-lived plants have adapted to particular interannual and intermillennial amplitudes of climate change.;MA47;CM;include;interspecific;mutualism-antagonism
Chilli-briquettes modify the temporal behaviour of elephants, but not their numbers;"Crop loss to foraging elephants is one of the most significant causes of conflict between people and elephants in areas where wild elephants share resources with people. Effective solutions to reduce the effects of human-elephant conflict on local livelihoods are thus essential to foster coexistence between elephants and people. We assessed the effectiveness of chilli-briquettes (bricks made of dry chilli, elephant dung and water) in altering elephants use of space in the eastern Okavango Panhandle, Botswana. We burned > 600 briquettes during the night over a 2-month period to test five treatments: Frequent burning of (1) chilli and (2) chilli-free briquettes, occasional burning of (3) chilli and (4) chilli-free briquettes, and (5) a control treatment. Using camera traps and footprint surveys we assessed the number of elephants that used experimental sites, and the times at which they did so. We found elephants changed their movement behaviour from predominantly nocturnal to diurnal in areas where chilli-briquettes were burned throughout the night; however, there was no difference in the mean numbers of individuals between treatments with and without chillies. In other words, chilli-briquettes had a repellent but not a deterrent effect on elephants, keeping them away only at times when chilli-briquettes were smouldering. Based on these findings we recommend the use of chilli-briquettes as a method to deter elephants in the short term. In the long term, chilli-briquettes should be applied in combination with other larger-scale mitigation approaches, such as land management and cooperative community-based tools.  2017 Fauna and Flora International.";MA45;CM;exclude;;
Global associations between birds and vane-dwelling feather mites;Understanding host-symbiont networks is a major question in evolutionary ecology. Birds host a great diversity of endo- and ectosymbiotic organisms, with feather mites (Arachnida: Acariformes: Analgoidea, Pterolichoidea) being among the most diverse of avian symbionts. A global approach to the ecology and evolution of bird-feather-mite associations has been hampered because of the absence of a centralized data repository. Here we present the most extensive data set of associations between feather mites and birds. Data include 12 036 records of 1887 feather mite species located on the flight feathers of 2234 bird species from 147 countries. Feather mites typically located inside quills, on the skin, or on downy body feathers are not included. Data were extracted from 493 published sources dating from 1882 to 2015. Data exploration shows that although most continents and bird families are represented, most bird species remain unexplored for feather mites. Nevertheless, this is the most comprehensive data set available for enabling global macroecological analyses of feather mites and their hosts, such as ecological network analyses. This metadata file outlines the structure of these data and provides primary references for all records used.  2016 Ecological Society of America.;MA168;CM;exclude;;
Do seed-dispersing birds exert selection on optimal plant trait combinations? Correlated phenotypic selection on the fruit and seed size of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna);Seed-dispersing birds can be expected to optimize their energy intake through fruit selection and hence exert a positive selection on fruit pulp content, that is to say, favoring big fruits with small seeds. On the other hand they may select both, average fruit size and its variation. We addressed this issue by analyzing the phenotypic selection exerted by the dispersers of Crataegus monogyna on the fruit and seed size of this species. Fruit and seed size were analyzed at two ontogenic plant stages: the initial size of seeds (and their fruits) as future individuals and the mean size of fruits and seeds produced by adult plants. Fruit diameter and its within-individual variation are the actual targets of selection for maternal fruit traits, negatively affecting relative fitness, although total selection acts only on mean fruit size. For individual seeds, size selection is positive and directed at fruit diameter and seed length, while the remaining traits are subject to indirect selection. Birds exerted a correlational selection favoring big fruits with small seeds. Nevertheless the evolutionary consequences of this selection are expected to be limited by several factors. For example, the positive correlation between fruit and seed sizes, the existence of counteracting selective pressures exerted by other mutualistic or antagonist interactions and temporal or spatial changes in the environmental conditions that may alter the selective forces and even the optimum phenotype in each situation.;MA99;CM;exclude;;
Under high stakes and uncertainty the rich should lend the poor a helping hand;In social dilemmas, there is tension between individual incentives to optimize personal gain versus social benefits. An additional cause of conflict in such social dilemmas is heterogeneity. Cultural differences or financial inequity often interfere with decision making when a diverse group of individuals interact. We address these issues in situations where individuals are either rich or poor. Often, it is unclear how rich and poor individuals should interact should the poor invest the same as the rich, or should the rich assist the poor? Which distribution of efforts can be considered as fair? To address the effects of heterogeneity on decisions, we model a collective-risk dilemma where players collectively have to invest more than a certain threshold, with heterogeneity and multiple rounds. We aim to understand the natural behavior and to infer which strategies are particularly stable in such asymmetric collective-risk games. Large scale individual based simulations show that when the poor players have half of the wealth the rich players posses, the poor contribute only when early contributions are made by the rich players. The rich contribute on behalf of the poor only when their own external assets are worth protecting. Under a certain degree of uncertainty we observe the rich maintain cooperation by assisting the poor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The evolving dynamics of the microbial community in the cystic fibrosis lung;The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung is a niche colonized by a diverse group of organisms, with a more limited number of species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominating in adult patients. Whether all members of this microbial community play a direct or indirect role in pulmonary decline has yet to be fully elucidated, but investigations of their interactions with both co-colonizing species and with host cells are beginning to shed light on their virulence potential. It is also emerging that some microbial species within this community adapt as chronic infection is established to survive the hostile environment of the lung, to minimize host clearance and to resist therapeutic intervention. This review highlights the recent developments in CF microbiology focusing on the cooperative, competitive and adaptive interactions of established and emerging pathogens in the lung microbiome.  2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;MA374;CM;exclude;;
Behavioural type, status and social context affect behaviour and resource allocation in cooperatively breeding cichlids;Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates) according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social contexts, especially in highly social species.

Interactions of spatial strategies producing generalization gradient and blocking: A computational approach;We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.  2018 Doll et al.;MA211;CM;exclude;;
Community-wide consequences of sexual dimorphism: evidence from nectar microbes in dioecious plants;Intraspecific trait variation is receiving renewed interest as a factor affecting the structure of multi-species communities within and across trophic levels. One pervasive form of intraspecific trait variation is sexual dimorphism in animals and plants, which might exert large effects particularly on the communities of host-associated organisms, but the extent of these effects is not well understood. We investigated whether host-associated microbial communities developed differently in the floral nectar of female and male individuals of the dioecious shrubs, Eurya emarginata and E.japonica. We found that nectar-colonizing microbes such as bacteria and fungi were more than twice as prevalent and, overall, more than 10 times as abundant in male flowers as in female flowers. Microbial species composition also differed between flower sexes. To examine potential mechanisms behind these differences, we manipulated the frequency of flower visitation by animals and the order of arrival of microbial species to nectar. Animal visitation frequency affected microbial communities more greatly in male flowers, while arrival order affected them more in female flowers. These sex-specific effects appeared attributable to differences in how animals and microbes altered the chemical characteristics of nectar that limited microbial growth. Taken together, our results provide evidence that sexual dimorphism can have large effects on the structure of host-associated communities.  2018 by the Ecological Society of America;MA56;CM;exclude;;
Sociosexuality, testosterone, and life history status: prospective associations and longitudinal changes among men in Cebu, Philippines;Sociosexuality is defined as an individual's interest in uncommitted sexual activity and can be measured in terms of both psychological orientations and behavioral expression. In socio-ecological contexts in which adults monogamously partner and cooperate to raise children, individuals with unrestricted sociosexuality are likely to prioritize mating/competition over committed partnering and parenting. Given the importance of mother-father cooperation in the evolutionary past, humans may have the capacity to facultatively and opportunistically downregulate sociosexuality to focus on priorities related to invested partnering and parenting. To date, no prior studies have used longitudinal data to track within-individuals changes in sociosexuality as it relates to such life history transitions. Given the lack of prior longitudinal research in this area, it is likewise unknown what physiological mechanisms might mediate within-individual changes in sociosexuality through time but testosterone is a plausible candidate. To explore these questions, we drew on a large, long-running study of Filipino men (n = 288), who were single non-fathers at 25.9 years of age and were followed up 4-5 years later. We found that men with more unrestricted sociosexuality at baseline were more likely to experience relationship dissolution by follow-up, consistent with past work. Compared to men who remained single non-fathers at followup, men who became married residential fathers showed shifts towards more restricted global sociosexuality as well as sociosexual behavior. Relative to their own baseline values, married residential fathers also had more restricted sociosexuality in all domains at follow-up. They were the only group for whom this was found. We found theoretically-consistent but modest support for positive correlations between men's testosterone and their sociosexuality, but no evidence that the two change in tandem together through time. Our results suggest that some amount of between-individual differences in sociosexuality are not stable and can facultatively shift alongside other aspects of male reproductive effort.;MA339;CM;include;intraspecific;male-female
Patterns of participation and free riding in territorial conflicts among ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta);"Cooperation in animal social groups may be limited by the threat of ""free riding,"" the potential for individuals to reap the benefits of other individuals' actions without paying their share of the costs. Here we investigate the factors that influence individual contributions to group-level benefits by studying individual participation in territorial defense among female ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta). To control for potentially confounding factors, particularly group size, we studied two semi-free-ranging groups at the Duke University Primate Center. First, we used a combination of experimental and observational methods to investigate the costs and benefits of territorial defense for individual lemurs. We found three indications of costs: physical contact occurred during inter-group encounters, participation in territorial defense was negatively correlated with ambient temperature, and rates of self-directed behaviors increased during encounters. Benefits were more difficult to quantify, but observational and experimental tests suggested that individuals shared the gains of territorial defense by foraging in defended territories. Thus, during experiments in which one of the groups was prevented from defending its territory, the free-ranging group made more frequent incursions into the other group's territory. Second, we examined variation in participation in territorial defense. Individuals varied significantly in their rates of aggression and genital marking during inter-group encounters. The extensive variation documented among individuals was partially accounted for by dominance rank, kinship and patterns of parental care. However, we found no evidence to suggest that participation was enforced through punishment (policing) or exchange of benefits involving grooming. In conclusion, this study provides further insights into cooperative behavior in mammalian social groups by revealing how the costs and benefits of territoriality influence patterns of individual participation in the context of shared (collective) goods.

Helping effort in primitively eusocial wasps;In primitively eusocial and cooperatively breeding societies, there is substantial individual variation in helping effort that is not accounted for by variation in genetic relatedness. In primitively eusocial wasps, helpers have a significant chance of inheriting breeding positions. Recent models suggest that because helpers with greater expected future fitness have more to lose, they should invest less in rearing the dominant's offspring. Observations and experiments on the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata support this prediction: helpers nearer to the front of the queue to inherit dominance, and helpers that stand to inherit larger, more productive groups, work less hard. These findings support the view that variation in social traits is best understood from a life-history perspective. Group augmentation effects, where greater helping effort leads to direct benefits through increased group size, seem less important in wasps. Further studies are required to understand how conflicts over helping effort are resolved in social wasps.

Ecological effects on gut bacterial communities in wild bumblebee colonies;1.Animal hosts harbour diverse and often specific bacterial communities (microbiota) in their gut. These microbiota can provide crucial services to the host such as aiding in digestion of food and immune defence. However, the ecological factors correlating with and eventually shaping these microbiota under natural conditions are poorly understood. 2.Bumblebees have recently been shown to possess simple and highly specific microbiota. We here examine the dynamics of these microbiota in field colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris over one season. The gut bacteria were assessed with culture-independent methods, that is, with terminal restriction fragment length profiles of the 16S rRNA gene. 3.To further understand the factors that affect the microbiota, we experimentally manipulated field-placed colonies in a fully factorial experiment by providing additional food or by priming the workers' immune system by injecting heat-killed bacteria. We furthermore looked at possible correlates of diversity and composition of the microbiota for (i) natural infections with the microbial parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi, (ii) bumblebee worker size, (iii) colony identity, and (iv) colony age. 4.We found an increase in diversity of the microbiota in individuals naturally infected with either C. bombi or N. bombi. Crithidia bombi infections, however, appear to be only indirectly linked with higher microbial diversity when comparing colonies. The treatments of priming the immune system with heat-killed bacteria and additional food supply, as well as host body size, had no effect on the diversity or composition of the microbiota. Host colony identity had only a weak effect on the composition of the microbiota at the level of resolution of our method. We found both significant increases and decreases in the relative abundance of selected bacterial taxa over the season. 5.We present the first study on the ecological dynamics of gut microbiota in bumblebees and identify parasite infections, colony identity and colony age as important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities. The absence of an effect of our otherwise effective experimental treatments suggests a remarkable ability of the host to maintain a homoeostasis in this community under widely different environments.  2012 British Ecological Society.;MA111;CM;exclude;;
Allometry of animal-microbe interactions and global census of animal-associated microbes;"Animals live in close association with microorganisms, mostly prokaryotes, living in or on them as commensals, mutualists or parasites, and profoundly affecting host fitness. Most animal-microbe studies focus on microbial community structure; for this project, allometry (scaling of animal attributes with animal size) was applied to animal-microbe relationships across a range of species spanning 12 orders of magnitude in animal mass, from nematodes to whales. Microbial abundances per individual animal were gleaned from published literature and also microscopically counted in three species. Abundance of prokaryotes/individual versus animal mass scales as a nearly linear power function (exponent = 1.07, R =0.94). Combining this power function with allometry of animal abundance indicates that macrofauna have an outsized share of animal-associated microorganisms. The total number of animal-associated prokaryotes in Earths land animals was calculated to be 1.3-1.4 x 102 cells and the total of marine animal-associated microbes was calculated to be 8.6-9.0 x 10 cells. Animal-associated microbes thus total 2.1-2.3 x 102 of the approximately 10 prokaryotes on the Earth. Microbes associated with humans comprise 3.3-3.5% of Earths animal-associated microbes, and domestic animals harbour 14-20% of all animal-associated microbes, adding a new dimension to the scale of human impact on the biosphere. This novel allometric power function may reflect underlying mechanisms involving the transfer of energy and materials between microorganisms and their animal hosts. Microbial diversity indices of animal gut communities and gut microbial species richness for 60 mammals did not indicate significant scaling relationships with animal body mass; however, further research in this area is warranted.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Cooperation promotes the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites with unitary growth;"Most animals have specialized into separate sexes but most plants remain hermaphroditic. The underlining cause for this is still unclear. Here we address this question by evolutionary stable strategy analysis and exact calculation of frequency-dependent selection and genetic drift in geographically structured populations. Reproductive investments of hermaphrodites are divided into male and female functions, and each sex requires linear investments that increase linearly with successful gamete number and reusable investments (RIs) that increase less than linearly. Individuals specializing into one sex require RIs of only this sex and thus can produce more gametes. However, these gametes suffer strong kin competition as they are of the same sex and gamete number of the other sex decreases. The success of individuals specializing into one sex requires individuals specializing into the other sex to cooperate with them, providing them with more opposite-sex gametes and relaxing them of the same-sex competition. The evolution of this cooperation does not require two rare mutations to happen simultaneously at the same place, because single-sex mutants can sparsely spread in a hermaphroditic population with RIs despite genetic drift and wait for mutants of the other sex to arise. RI resembles fixed cost in previous theories. However, previous theories considered all costs except for costs for gametes as fixed costs and this does not capture an important plant-animal difference; modular growth of sexual organs in most plants and some animals promotes reproductive investments to increase linearly with offspring number, so their investments in sexual organs are linear investments rather than fixed costs. This study shows the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites as an example of the evolution of cooperation and mutualism as in harmony games, and highlights modular growth as an important factor that prevents most plants and some animals from evolving into separate sexes.

COMPETITION VERSUS COOPERATION - SUCCESS OF INDIVIDUALS FORAGING ALONE AND IN GROUPS;Using a variant of information-sharing models, we examine the pros and cons of group foraging against the alternative of staying alone. Models of this category-assuming that in groups food finding by one results in food sharing by many-conclude that patch-finding rate improves with group size. In our modification interference among individuals reduces pooled searching efficiency of the group. We introduce a term, s, the probability of an individual's being among the ones sharing the food in a patch found by the group. Not unexpectedly, these fine-tunings prolong food-finding rates that push individuals in the group toward the foraging status of a solitary individual. With phenotype-related differences in s, foraging in groups turns out to be a less profitable option the lower an individual is ranked in the group. The model suggests that, in terms of food finding, individuals have to pay attention to their performance in the foraging group. The option of foraging alone may easily be a better strategy than that of a low-ranking individual foraging in a group. If so, the model also suggests groups assorted by phenotype.;MA62;CM;include;intraspecific;theoretical/modelling, cooperation
Social complexity: patterns, processes, and evolution;Abstract: Animal and human societies exhibit extreme diversity in the size, composition and cohesion of their social units, in the patterning of sex-specific reproductive skew, in the nature of parental care, in the form and frequency of cooperation and in their competitive regime, creating a diversity of socially complex societies. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether social complexity is a real, emergent property of a society or whether it only provides a conceptual framework for studying the diversity and evolution of societies. In this introduction to our topical collection, we identify three areas of current research addressing relevant challenges in the study of social complexity. First, previous studies have suffered from a lack of a common conceptual framework, including shared definitions, and existing measures of social complexity do not acknowledge its multiple components and dimensions. Second, most previous studies have ignored intraspecific variation, and the proximate and ultimate determinants of variation in social complexity, as well as their interactions, remain poorly known. Third, comparative studies of social complexity offer opportunities to explore its biological causes and correlates and but it is frequently difficult to identify the causal relationships involved and the development of general insights has been hampered by conceptual and methodological difficulties. In this paper, we briefly characterize these three challenges and offer guidance to the other contributions to this topical collection on social complexity by placing their key results in the context of these three topics. Significance statement: In this paper, we address the main current challenges in the study of social complexity and combine our brief overview with a synopsis of the other contributions to this topical collection on various aspects of social complexity.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;MA333;CM;exclude;;
Dihydrofolate reductase as a therapeutic target;"The folate antagonists are an important class of therapeutic compounds, as evidenced by their use as antiinfective, antineoplastic, and antiinflammatory drugs. Thus far, all of the clinically useful drugs of this class have been inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the synthesis of thymidylate, and therefore, of DNA. The basis of the antiinfective selectivity of these compounds is clear; the antifolates trimethoprim and pyrimethamine are potent inhibitors of bacterial and protozoal DHFRs, respectively, but are only weak inhibitors of mammalian DHFRs. These species-selective agents apparently exploit the differences in the active site regions of the parasite and host enzymes. Methotrexate is the DHFR inhibitor used most often in a clinical setting as an anticancer drug and as an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agent. Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the biochemical basis for the selectivity of this drug and the biochemical mechanism (or mechanisms) responsible for the development of resistance to treatment with the drug. This understanding has led to a new generation of DHFR inhibitors that are now in clinical trials.";MA91;CM;exclude;;
How individual and relative size affect participation in territorial defense and cortisol levels in a social fish;For many species, behaviors such as territory defense and parental care are energetically costly, but are nonetheless can provide substantial fitness gains. In systems in which both parents provide parental care, each of the parents benefits from exhibiting (or having their partner exhibit) these behaviors. However, in many cases, costs and benefits differ between parents due to factors such as size or sex. Different intruder types may also impose different costs on parents. Predatory intruders might consume offspring, whereas conspecifics might threaten the social status of a parent, or provide benefits as a potential group joiner or mate. Responses to these intrusions may also be associated with variation in individual stress responses. We investigated associations among male and female sizes, and the interaction between these, with defense against conspecific and heterospecific territorial intruders by members of successfully breeding pairs in the cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We also investigated whether cortisol levels were associated with size or participation in territory defense because each may be a cause or consequence of individual variation in the stress response. We found that females paired with large males performed fewer defensive behaviors than females paired with smaller males. Males paired with relatively large females had higher baseline cortisol levels than those paired with smaller females. Collectively, individual characteristics such as size have consequences for each individual's behavior, and also influence the behavior, and endocrine state of social partners.;MA188;CM;include;intraspecific, interspecific;cooperation
Concordance of bacterial communities of two tick species and blood of their shared rodent host;High-throughput sequencing is revealing that most macro-organisms house diverse microbial communities. Of particular interest are disease vectors whose microbiome could potentially affect pathogen transmission and vector competence. We investigated bacterial community composition and diversity of the ticks Dermacentor variabilis (n = 68) and Ixodes scapularis (n = 15) and blood of their shared rodent host, Peromyscus leucopus (n = 45) to quantify bacterial diversity and concordance. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs. Our results point to complex microbial assemblages inhabiting ticks and host blood including infectious agents, tick-specific endosymbionts and environmental bacteria that could potentially affect arthropod-vectored disease dynamics.  2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;MA69;CM;exclude;;
Divergent host phenotypes create opportunities and constraints on the distribution of two wing-dwelling feather mites;The diversity of symbionts (commensals, mutualists or parasites) that share the same host species may depend on opportunities and constraints on host exploitation associated with host phenotype or environment. Various host traits may differently influence host accessibility and within-host population growth of each symbiont species, or they may determine the outcome of within-host interactions among coexisting species. In turn, phenotypic diversity of a host species may promote divergent exploitation strategies among its symbiotic organisms. We studied the distribution of two feather mite species, Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata, among blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla wintering in southern Spain during six winters. The host population included migratory and sedentary individuals, which were unequally distributed between two habitat types (forests and shrublands). Visual mite counts showed that both mite species often coexisted on sedentary blackcaps, but were seldom found together on migratory blackcaps. Regardless of host habitat, Proctophyllodes were highly abundant and Trouessartia were scarce on migratory blackcaps, but the abundance of both mite species converged in intermediate levels on sedentary blackcaps. Coexistence may come at a cost for Proctophyllodes, whose load decreased when Trouessartia was present on the host (the opposite was not true). Proctophyllodes load was positively correlated with host wing length (wings were longer in migratory blackcaps), while Trouessartia load was positively correlated to uropygial gland size (sedentary blackcaps had bigger glands), which might render migratory and sedentary blackcaps better hosts for Proctophyllodes and Trouessartia, respectively. Our results draw a complex scenario for mite co-existence in the same host species, where different mite species apparently take advantage of, or are constrained by, divergent host phenotypic traits. This expands our understanding of bird-mite interactions, which are usually viewed as less dynamic in relation to variation in host phenotype, and emphasizes the role of host phenotypic divergence in the diversification of symbiotic organisms.  2012 The Authors.;MA94;CM;include;interspecific;co-existence
Determinants of sperm transfer in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata: male variation, female condition and copulation duration;Recent studies suggest that sperm production and transfer may have significant costs to males. Male sperm investment into a current copulation may therefore influence resources available for future matings, which selects for male strategic mating investment. In addition, females may also benefit from actively or passively altering the number of sperm transferred by males. In the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata, the number of sperm transferred during copulation depended on copulation duration and males in good condition (residual weight) copulated longer and also transferred more sperm. Moreover, sperm transferred and stored per unit time was higher in copulations with females in good condition than in copulations with females in poor condition. Males varied greatly and consistently in their sperm transfer rate, indicative of costs associated with this trait. The duration of the pairing prelude also varied between males and correlated negatively with the male's sperm transfer rate, but no other male character correlated significantly with male sperm transfer rate. The results are consistent with strategic mating effort but sperm transfer could also be facilitated by the physical size of females and/or females in good condition may be more cooperative during sperm transfer.;MA89;CM;exclude;;
Bet hedging based cooperation can limit kin selection and form a basis for mutualism;Mutualism is a mechanism of cooperation in which partners that differ help each other. As such, mutualism opposes mechanisms of kin selection and tag-based selection (for example the green beard mechanism), which are based on giving exclusive help to partners that are related or carry the same tag. In contrast to kin selection, which is a basis for parochialism and intergroup warfare, mutualism can therefore be regarded as a mechanism that drives peaceful coexistence between different groups and individuals. Here the competition between mutualism and kin (tag) selection is studied. In a model where kin selection and tag-based selection are dominant, mutualism is promoted by introducing environmental fluctuations. These fluctuations cause reduction in reproductive success by the mechanism of variance discount. The best strategy to counter variance discount is to share with agents who experience the most anticorrelated fluctuations, a strategy called bet hedging. In this way, bet hedging stimulates cooperation with the most unrelated partners, which is a basis for mutualism. Analytic results and simulations reveal that, if this effect is large enough, mutualistic strategies can dominate kin selective strategies. In addition, mutants of these mutualistic strategies that experience fluctuations that are more anticorrelated to their partner, can outcompete wild type, which can lead to the evolution of specialization. In this way, the evolutionary success of mutualistic strategies can be explained by bet hedging-based cooperation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Regional collapse of symbiotic specificity between lucanid beetles and canestriniid mites;The intensity of interspecific interactions between hosts and symbionts varies among populations of each organism because of differences in the biotic and abiotic environment. We found geographic mosaics in associations between lucanid beetles (Dorcus rectus and Dorcus striatipennis) and symbiotic mites (Haitlingeria sp. and Sandrophela sp., respectively) that were caused by the collapse of host specificity in the northern part of Japan. Haitlingeria sp. was only collected from the surface of the exoskeleton ofD. rectus in south and central Japan. Sandrophela sp. showed host specificity in southern to central Japan but was found on both beetle species in areas where Haitlingeria sp. was not found. Because Haitlingeria sp. was able to reproduce on D. rectus collected from Haitlingeria-free regions and no significant differences were observed in average temperature between the hostspecific and nonspecific regions bordering on each other, we suggest that the expansion of Haitlingeria sp. in the north has been limited for unknown reasons. When both mites were placed together on D. rectus, only Haitlingeria sp. reproduced, probably because it killed Sandrophela sp., especially juveniles. Thus, we conclude that Sandrophela sp. has expanded its host use to include D. rectus in areas where Haitlingeria sp. is absent. We hypothesise that false host specificity in the canestriniids has been maintained by habitat isolation and/or aggressive behaviour toward competitors.We suggest that host-specific canestriniids provide benefits to hosts that do not develop countermeasures to exclude microor macroparasites from their surfaces.

Evolution, adaptation, and host selection by plant viruses: Current understanding and future perspectives;Plant viruses are the most abundant and genetically diverse biological entities. They are infectious agents with small genome sizes and require living host cells to complete their life cycles. So far, the origin and evolution of plant viruses is mystery, but several experimental and molecular evidences indicate that plant viruses have been evolved as a result of symbiogenesis or through competition. Different selection pressures in different hosts will result in fitness trade-offs across hosts, leading to specialization. Newly emerged viruses have their origin in host species or populations in which they are well established and their emergence get influenced by various factors viz. alternation in the host plant and/or virus ecology, changes in genetic composition of the host and virus population, and in the case of vectored viruses, changes in the ecology or genetic composition of the vector. Like other living entities, viruses substantially resemble the parent during their replication, but can change to give rise to new type strains. This inherent variation enables viruses to adapt to new and changing situations. However, the complete picture of virus-virus and virus-host interactions is much more complex, since the viral populations constantly evolves and adapt to their new hosts and vectors and ultimately affects ecosystem dynamics. Considering these points, this chapter provides deep insights into the current understanding and future perspectives of evolution, adaptation, and host selection by plant viruses.  2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.;MA131;CM;exclude;;
Manipulation of population density and food availability affects home range sizes of African striped mouse females;"An individual's home range determines its access to resources, significantly influencing its fitness. Food availability and population density are considered to be among the primary factors influencing home range sizes; however, no study has experimentally tested whether these two factors affect home range sizes independently. This is important as these two factors correlate significantly with each other, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of one from the other. First, we supplemented food to 23 female African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, belonging to 15 different groups. To avoid an increase in population density by immigration, we also provided food to neighbouring groups. Although population density did not increase, female home range sizes decreased by 43.1\%. In a second experiment, we manipulated population density by removing entire social groups of striped mice. We carried out experiments within 7 weeks, a period short enough to control for a change in natural food availability. Experimental decrease of population density caused an increase of female home range sizes of 44.3\%. The degree of home range overlap between female striped mice was unaffected by supplemental feeding or by reduction of population density. However, female home range sizes were negatively affected by the total number of female neighbours, especially of heavier individuals. In addition, after removal, females significantly decreased their overlap with neighbouring breeding females indicating that competition with same-sex individuals shapes females' home ranges. This is the first comprehensive experimental field study demonstrating that an increase in food availability and a decrease in population density independently affect home range sizes of individuals.

Dynamics of populations with individual variation in dispersal on bounded domains;Most classical models for the movement of organisms assume that all individuals have the same patterns and rates of movement (for example, diffusion with a fixed diffusion coefficient) but there is empirical evidence that movement rates and patterns may vary among different individuals. A simple way to capture variation in dispersal that has been suggested in the ecological literature is to allow individuals to switch between two distinct dispersal modes. We study models for populations whose members can switch between two different nonzero rates of diffusion and whose local population dynamics are subject to density dependence of logistic type. The resulting models are reaction-diffusion systems that can be cooperative at some population densities and competitive at others. We assume that the focal population inhabits a bounded region and study how its overall dynamics depend on the parameters describing switching rates and local population dynamics. (Traveling waves and spread rates have been studied for similar models in the context of biological invasions.) The analytic methods include ideas and results from reaction-diffusion theory, semi-dynamical systems, and bifurcation/continuation theory.;MA109;CM;include;intraspecific;theoretical/modelling, cooperation
How to be an ant on figs;Mutualistic interactions are open to exploitation by one or other of the partners and a diversity of other organisms, and hence are best understood as being embedded in a complex network of biotic interactions. Figs participate in an obligate mutualism in that figs are dependent on agaonid fig wasps for pollination and the wasps are dependent on fig ovules for brood sites. Ants are common insect predators and abundant in tropical forests. Ants have been recorded on approximately 11\% of fig species, including all six subgenera, and often affect the fig-fig pollinator interaction through their predation of either pollinating and parasitic wasps. On monoecious figs, ants are often associated with hemipterans, whereas in dioecious figs ants predominantly prey on fig wasps. A few fig species are true myrmecophytes, with domatia or food rewards for ants, and in at least one species this is linked to predation of parasitic fig wasps. Ants also play a role in dispersal of fig seeds and may be particularly important for hemi-epiphytic species, which require high quality establishment microsites in the canopy. The intersection between the fig-fig pollinator and ant-plant systems promises to provide fertile ground for understanding mutualistic interactions within the context of complex interaction networks.

Emergence of ratio-dependent and predator-dependent functional responses for pollination mutualism and seed parasitism;Prey (N) dependence {[}g(N)], predator (P) dependence {[}g(P) or g(N,P)], and ratio dependence {[}f(P/N)] are often seen as contrasting forms of the predator's functional response describing predator consumption rates on prey resources in predator-prey and parasitoid-host interactions. Analogously, prey-, predator-, and ratio-dependent functional responses are apparently alternative functional responses for other types of consumer-resource interactions. These include, for example, the fraction of flowers pollinated or seeds parasitized in pollination (pre-dispersal) seed-parasitism mutualisms, such as those between fig wasps and fig trees or yucca moths and yucca plants. Here we examine the appropriate functional responses for how the fraction of flowers pollinated and seeds parasitized vary with the density of pollinators (predator dependence) or the ratio of pollinator and flower densities (ratio dependence). We show that both types of functional responses can emerge from minor, but biologically important variations on a single model. An individual-based model was first used to describe plant-pollinator interactions. Conditional upon on whether the number of flowers visited by the pollinator was limited by factors other than search time (e.g., by the number of eggs it had to lay, if it was also a seed parasite), and on whether the pollinator could directly find flowers on a plant, or had to search, the simulation results lead to either a predator-dependent or a ratio-dependent functional response. An analytic model was then used to show mathematically how these two cases can arise. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.;MA118;CM;exclude;;
