Intraspecific variation in allelochemistry determines an invasive species' impact on soil microbial communities,"
Invasive species can benefit from altered species interactions in their new range, and by interfering with species interactions among native competitors. Since exotic invasions are generally studied at the species level, relatively little is known about intraspecific variation in the traits that determine an invader's effect on native species. Alliaria petiolata is a widespread and aggressive invader of forest understories that succeeds in part by interfering with mutualistic interactions between native plants and soil fungi. Here, I show that the impact of A. petiolata on soil microbial communities varied among individuals due to variation in their allelochemical concentrations. The differential impacts translated into varied effects on native tree growth, partly because A. petiolata's allelochemicals preferentially affected the most mutualistic fungal taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering the spatial and temporal variation in an invasive species' impacts for understanding and managing the invasion process.

Competing for seed dispersal: evidence for the role of avian seed hoarders in mediating apparent predation among oaks,"
In communities of large-seeded tree species, generalist seed hoarders often link the temporally variable dynamics of various species in ways that can result in indirect ecological interactions. A special case of such interactions is apparent predation' - when variation in seed production of one tree species changes the outcome of the interaction between seed hoarders and another tree species from seed dispersal mutualism to predation. We investigated how two species of avian hoarders responded to differences in acorn availability among individual valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and across a landscape dominated by blue oaks (Q.douglasii) to determine whether seed dispersal and predation dynamics result in apparent predation between these oak species. California scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica), high-quality seed dispersers with large spatial scales of resource perception, showed strong numerical and functional responses to individually large Q.lobata acorn crops when landscape-level acorn crops were low, but the numerical response was not observed when Q.douglasii produced a good acorn crop the subsequent year. In contrast, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), which are significant acorn predators, exhibited a consistent functional response to individual Q.lobata acorn crops independent of landscape-wide availability. Consequently, Q.lobata experienced increased predation and a near absence of high-quality seed dispersal when Q.douglasii acorns were abundant. Our results suggest that apparent predation among oak species can arise from contrasting responses of generalist seed predators and dispersers to acorn availability on different spatial scales. Thus, the spatial scale of resource perception, which can differ greatly among generalist seed hoarders, may provide a proximate mechanism underlying indirect, temporally variable ecological affects such as apparent predation among sympatric species of large-seeded trees.

Complex network representation of multiagent systems with cooperative and competitive interactions,"
The dynamic behavior of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is analyzed in the context of a modifed Lotka-Volterra model. The interaction strength is determined by the difference of agent sizes: as the difference increases, the interaction is weaker. Competitive and cooperative scenarios are analyzed, showing clusters of agents in the stationary state. However, meantime in the competitive scenario the agent sizes are constrained to be non greater than the capacity value ( = 1), in the cooperative scenario, they are allowed to exceed such capacity making clear the advantages of cooperation. The complex network representation is introduced in order to enhance the role of agent sizes and their one-on-one interactions in the dynamic behavior of the system. 2014 by the Author.

Policing and group cohesion when resources vary,"
The transition from competing individuals to cooperative groups has occurred several times in evolutionary history. The puzzle is why selfish individuals did not subvert cohesive group behaviour by taking resources without contributing to the group's overall success. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism are the two standard explanations for group cohesion. But many groups have evolved into cooperative units when relatedness was low and opportunities were limited for the strategic alliances required for reciprocity. A new theory was recently proposed in which individuals invest some of their resources into repressing competition between group members. Such policing increases the fair distribution of resources in the group and enhances group cohesion. The surprising aspect of this theory is that low relatedness is more conducive to the spread of policing traits than is high relatedness. Here a new explanation is developed of the biological processes that favour policing. The model is then extended in two ways. First, more realism is added to the theory by accounting for the full range of costs and benefits associated with competitive and cooperative traits within groups. Second, another surprising result is introduced about cooperative evolution. Small variations in individual vigour or resources can lead to large variations in individual contributions to policing the group. Stronger individuals often invest all of their excess resources into policing, but weaker individuals do not contribute to group cohesion. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Intergroup encounters in Verreauxs sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi): who fights and why?,"
Abstract: Individuals living in groups have to achieve collective action for successful territorial defense. Because conflicts between neighboring groups always involve risks and costs, individuals must base their decision to participate in a given conflict on an evaluation of the trade-off between potential costs and benefits. Since group members may differ in motivation to engage in group encounters, they exhibit different levels of participation in conflicts. In this study, we investigated factors influencing participation in intergroup encounters in Verreauxs sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi), a group-living primate from Madagascar. Over a period of 12months, we studied eight adjacent sifaka groups in Kirindy Forest. We observed 71 encounters between known neighboring groups in which adult females and males participated equally as often. No individual participated in every encounter, and non-participation occurred more often in larger groups. Females participated less often in encounters when they had dependent infants, presumably to reduce the risk of infanticide. Male participation was influenced by social status: dominant males participated in most encounters, whereas males with fewer opportunities to reproduce participated less often, hence male participation is influenced by the incentive of maintaining access to females. The number of actively participating individuals in the opponent group positively influenced theparticipation in both sexes. Thus, sifakas seem to decide joining a given encounter opportunistically, most likely based on a combination of individual incentives and the actual circumstance of each encounter, suggesting that the complexity in intergroup relationships appears to be the product of decisions made by each individual group member. Significance statement: Cooperation among group-living animals is often challenged by collective action problems resulting from individual differences in interests in contributing to collective behaviors. Intergroup encounters involve distinguished costs and benefits for each individual despite being in the same social group. Therefore, encounters between groups offer a good opportunity to investigate individual participation in collective action. In this study, we investigate the influence of different incentives on individual participation in intergroup encounters in wild Malagasy primate, Verreauxs sifakas. We propose a novel approach that takes into account the variable circumstances of each conflict, such as the number of individuals fighting in both groups as a predictor for participation. We believe that our study not only provides novel data on wild sifakas, but it also offers new perspectives for the interpretation of intergroup relationships in other taxa. 2016, The Author(s).

Cooperation and conflict in the evolution of individuality .1. Multilevel selection of the organism,"
This article studies the transition in evolution from cells to multicellular organisms. The issues considered are applicable to all major transitions in the units of evolution that share two themes: the emergence of cooperation and the regulation of conflict among the lower-level units, in this case, cells. Explicit genetic models of mutation and selection both within and between organisms are studied in sexual and asexual haploid and diploid organisms without a germ line. The results may be understood in terms of the differing opportunities for within-and between-organism selection under the different reproductive modes and parameter values. Cooperation among cells increases when the fitness covariance at the level of the organism overcomes within-organism change toward defecting cells. Selection and mutation during development generate significant levels of within-organism variation and lead to significant variation in organism fitness at equilibrium. The levels of cooperativity attained can be low, even with reproduction passing through a single-cell zygote stage and the high kinship that entails. Sex serves to maintain higher levels of cooperation and lower levels of within-organism change. Fixed size may help organisms reduce conflict among cells.

"Trade-offs between social learning and individual innovativeness in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus","
Social learning and innovation are two different ways to acquire novel behaviours, and the form of the relationship between these two processes strongly affects cultural evolution. Whereas modelling results suggest a negative correlation between the two processes within a species, comparative data show, and the cultural intelligence hypothesis predicts, positive covariation across species. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty about the form of the relationship between social learning and innovation. We explored this problem experimentally in common marmosets. Social learning of 18 subjects was assessed by presenting a video clip of a conspecific demonstrator solving a complex foraging task and comparing their success to a control group. For the same subjects, the propensity to innovate was assessed with two tasks that operationalize different types of innovation: (1) a multistage problem-solving task to estimate goal-directed Type I innovation, that is, the ability to find a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, and (2) a flexibility task testing for more incidental Type II innovation, that is, the propensity to realize and switch to a novel, but easier solution after the establishment of a well-learned solution. Social learning was negatively correlated with Type II innovation, but not with Type I innovation. We discuss these results with regard to competition within an individual of the various attentional processes aimed at conspecifics' behaviour or aspects of the environment, and whether they might be the result of the cooperative breeding system shared by humans and callitrichids.

Small and variable sperm sizes suggest low sperm competition despite multiple paternity in a lekking suboscine bird,"
Sperm competition, whereby sperm from multiple males compete to fertilize an egg, selects for adaptations that increase fertilization success. Because fertilization success is related to sperm number, size, and quality, both interspecific and intraspecific variation in these traits are predicted to correlate with the level of sperm competition. Specifically, species and individuals that experience high sperm competition are predicted to produce more sperm per ejaculate, produce longer sperm, and exert higher quality control, resulting in reduced numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm and reduced size variation via selection for the most successful sperm phenotype. However, the causes of sperm morphological and size variation and its consequences for sperm competition remain poorly understood, especially within species. We quantified variation in sperm morphology, size, and number in the Lancetailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata), a Neotropical suboscine passerine with a cooperative lek mating system. Although alpha-status males sire almost all chicks, the numbers of sperm produced per ejaculate by betas, nonterritorial adults, and subadult males were similar to those produced by alphas. Sperm counts declined with age in alphas, which may explain the decreased siring success of older alphas. Most ejaculates contained both normal helical sperm and abnormal sperm with rounded heads. The proportion of morphologically normal sperm per ejaculate was unrelated to social status or age. The coefficients of variation in sperm component length (head, tail, and total) both between and within alpha males were comparable to variation reported in passerines with low sperm competition. Total sperm length was shorter than in the majority of avian species studied to date, and cloacal protuberance and relative testis size were small. These results indicate low sperm competition, despite evidence for multiple paternity, or that sperm number rather than sperm morphology may be a major postcopulatory mediator of male reproductive success in this species. This work represents the first thorough quantification of intraspecific sperm variability in a suboscine passerine. Copyright 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.

Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History,"
Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern, whereby the ecological relatedness of host-associated microbial communities parallels the phylogeny of related host species. Here, we test the prevalence of phylosymbiosis and its functional significance under highly controlled conditions by characterizing the microbiota of 24 animal species from four different groups (Peromyscus deer mice, Drosophila flies, mosquitoes, and Nasonia wasps), and we reevaluate the phylosymbiotic relationships of seven species of wild hominids. We demonstrate three key findings. First, intraspecific microbiota variation is consistently less than interspecific microbiota variation, and microbiota-based models predict host species origin with high accuracy across the dataset. Interestingly, the age of host clade divergence positively associates with the degree of microbial community distinguishability between species within the host clades, spanning recent host speciation events (~1 million y ago) to more distantly related host genera (~108 million y ago). Second, topological congruence analyses of each group's complete phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram reveal significant degrees of phylosymbiosis, irrespective of host clade age or taxonomy. Third, consistent with selection on hostmicrobiota interactions driving phylosymbiosis, there are survival and performance reductions when interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between closely related and divergent host species pairs. Overall, these findings indicate that the composition and functional effects of an animal's microbial community can be closely allied with host evolution, even across wide-ranging timescales and diverse animal systems reared under controlled conditions. 2016 Brooks et al.

"Root Herbivore Effects on Aboveground Multitrophic Interactions: Patterns, Processes and Mechanisms","In terrestrial food webs, the study of multitrophic interactions traditionally has focused on organisms that share a common domain, mainly above ground. In the last two decades, it has become clear that to further understand multitrophic interactions, the barrier between the belowground and aboveground domains has to be crossed. Belowground organisms that are intimately associated with the roots of terrestrial plants can influence the levels of primary and secondary chemistry and biomass of aboveground plant parts. These changes, in turn, influence the growth, development, and survival of aboveground insect herbivores. The discovery that soil organisms, which are usually out of sight and out of mind, can affect plant-herbivore interactions aboveground raised the question if and how higher trophic level organisms, such as carnivores, could be influenced. At present, the study of above-belowground interactions is evolving from interactions between organisms directly associated with the plant roots and shoots (e.g., root feeders - plant - foliar herbivores) to interactions involving members of higher trophic levels (e.g., parasitoids), as well as non-herbivorous organisms (e.g., decomposers, symbiotic plant mutualists, and pollinators). This multitrophic approach linking above- and belowground food webs aims at addressing interactions between plants, herbivores, and carnivores in a more realistic community setting. The ultimate goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of species in communities and, ultimately how community interactions contribute to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we summarize studies on the effects of root feeders on aboveground insect herbivores and parasitoids and discuss if there are common trends. We discuss the mechanisms that have been reported to mediate these effects, from changes in concentrations of plant nutritional quality and secondary chemistry to defense signaling. Finally, we discuss how the traditional framework of fixed paired combinations of root- and shoot-related organisms feeding on a common plant can be transformed into a more dynamic and realistic framework that incorporates community variation in species, densities, space and time, in order to gain further insight in this exciting and rapidly developing field.",MA312,KJB,exclude,interspecific,Above-belowground interactions in terrestrial foodwebs,"only mentions community variation in species, not within species"
The histone variant H2A.Z and chromatin remodeler BRAHMA act coordinately and antagonistically to regulate transcription and nucleosome dynamics in Arabidopsis,"Plants adapt to environmental changes by regulating transcription and chromatin organization. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z and the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) have overlapping roles in positively and negatively regulating environmentally responsive genes in Arabidopsis, but the extent of this overlap was uncharacterized. Both factors have been associated with various changes in nucleosome positioning and stability in different contexts, but their specific roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization need further characterization. We show that H2A.Z and BRM co-localize at thousands of sites, where they interact both cooperatively and antagonistically in transcriptional repression and activation of genes involved in development and responses to environmental stimuli. We identified eight classes of genes that show distinct relationships between H2A.Z and BRM with respect to their roles in transcription. These include activating and silencing transcription both redundantly and antagonistically. We found that H2A.Z contributes to a range of different nucleosome properties, while BRM stabilizes nucleosomes where it binds and destabilizes or repositions flanking nucleosomes. We also found that, at many genes regulated by both BRM and H2A.Z, both factors overlap with binding sites of the light-regulated transcription factor FAR1-Related Sequence 9 (FRS9) and that a subset of these FRS9 binding sites are dependent on H2A.Z and BRM for accessibility. Collectively, we comprehensively characterized the antagonistic and cooperative contributions of H2A.Z and BRM to transcriptional regulation, and illuminated several interrelated roles in chromatin organization. The variability observed in their individual functions implies that both BRM and H2A.Z have more context-dependent roles than previously assumed.  2019 The Authors The Plant Journal  2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",MA378,KJB,exclude,molecular,,
Ant stoichiometry: elemental homeostasis in stage-structured colonies,"1. Organisms facing variation in food quality maintain elemental composition within limited bounds. Such stoichiometric homeostasis has often been considered a species-specific parameter, but stoichiometry can also vary intraspecifically across life stages, sexes and sizes. In colonial organisms with overlapping generations, stoichiometric variation among stages could lead to flexibility in colony-level elemental composition due to changes in internal demography 2. We examine how the balance of energy (sucrose) and nutrients (prey) affects growth rate and carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) homeostasis in a eusocial insect, the pavement ant Tetramorium caespitum. 3. Colony growth depended heavily on prey availability. However, sucrose scarcity led to higher worker mortality and production of smaller workers, suggesting sucrose availability will affect colony-level performance in a competitive environment. 4. In contrast, C : N : P stoichiometry of larvae, pupae, and workers varied mostly with sucrose availability. Biomass P content within life stages was lower in colonies receiving less access to sucrose. We suggest this difference arose primarily from shifts in individual ant mass coupled with negative P-body mass relationships. 5. Life stages differed considerably in elemental composition, and resource conditions affected colony stage structure. Nevertheless, variation in colony-level stoichiometry primarily reflected compositional differences within stages rather than shifts in internal demography.",MA17,KJB,exclude,,,
Rapid evolution of symbiont-mediated resistance compromises biological control of aphids by parasitoids,"There is growing interest in biological control as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to control pest insects. Aphids are among the most detrimental agricultural pests worldwide, and parasitoid wasps are frequently employed for their control. The use of asexual parasitoids may improve the effectiveness of biological control because only females kill hosts and because asexual populations have a higher growth rate than sexuals. However, asexuals may have a reduced capacity to track evolutionary change in their host populations. We used a factorial experiment to compare the ability of sexual and asexual populations of the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum to control caged populations of black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) of high and low clonal diversity. The aphids came from a natural population, and one-third of the aphid clones harbored Hamiltonella defensa, a heritable bacterial endosymbiont that increases resistance to parasitoids. We followed aphid and parasitoid population dynamics for 3months but found no evidence that the reproductive mode of parasitoids affected their effectiveness as biocontrol agents, independent of host clonal diversity. Parasitoids failed to control aphids in most cases, because their introduction resulted in strong selection for clones protected by H.defensa. The increasingly resistant aphid populations escaped control by parasitoids, and we even observed parasitoid extinctions in many cages. The rapid evolution of symbiont-conferred resistance in turn imposed selection on parasitoids. In cages where asexual parasitoids persisted until the end of the experiment, they became dominated by a single genotype able to overcome the protection provided by H.defensa. Thus, there was evidence for parasitoid counteradaptation, but it was generally too slow for parasitoids to regain control over aphid populations. It appears that when pest aphids possess defensive symbionts, the presence of parasitoid genotypes able to overcome symbiont-conferred resistance is more important for biocontrol success than their reproductive mode.  2017 The Authors.

Feather mite abundance varies but symbiotic nature of mite-host relationship does not differ between two ecologically dissimilar warblers,"Feather mites are obligatory ectosymbionts of birds that primarily feed on the oily secretions from the uropygial gland. Feather mite abundance varies within and among host species and has various effects on host condition and fitness, but there is little consensus on factors that drive variation of this symbiotic system. We tested hypotheses regarding how within-species and among-species traits explain variation in both (1) mite abundance and (2) relationships between mite abundance and host body condition and components of host fitness (reproductive performance and apparent annual survival). We focused on two closely related (Parulidae), but ecologically distinct, species: Setophaga cerulea (Cerulean Warbler), a canopy dwelling open-cup nester, and Protonotaria citrea (Prothonotary Warbler), an understory dwelling, cavity nester. We predicted that feather mites would be more abundant on and have a more parasitic relationship with P.citrea, and within P.citrea, females and older individuals would harbor greater mite abundances. We captured, took body measurements, quantified feather mite abundance on individuals primaries and rectrices, and monitored individuals and their nests to estimate fitness. Feather mite abundance differed by species, but in the opposite direction of our prediction. There was no relationship between mite abundance and any measure of body condition or fitness for either species or sex (also contrary to our predictions). Our results suggest that species biology and ecological context may influence mite abundance on hosts. However, this pattern does not extend to differential effects of mites on measures of host body condition or fitness.  2017 The Authors.

Potential for endophyte symbiosis to increase resistance of the native grass Poa alsodes to invasion by the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum,"Microbial symbionts can improve the competitive ability and stress tolerance of plant hosts and thus may enhance native plant resistance against invaders. We investigated whether symbiosis between a native grass, Poa alsodes, and a fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) improved the grass's ability to compete against Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a common invader in the eastern USA. We challenged naturally endophyte-symbiotic and experimentally endophyte-free P. alsodes plants with the invader. In the first experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and water availability to test for context-dependency in symbiont benefits. In the second experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and M. vimineum diversity (the number of invader populations), since greater intraspecific diversity is expected to improve invasion success and might alter the efficacy of symbiosis in invasion resistance. In both experiments, presence of the endophyte reduced the per plant biomass of M. vimineum and increased P. alsodes biomass. We found no evidence that benefits of the symbiont depended on water availability, and population-level diversity had a minor influence on M. vimineum: inflorescence number showed a parabolic relationship with increasing numbers of M. vimineum populations. Overall, symbiosis in the native grass had stronger effects on invader growth than either water availability or invader genetic diversity. Our results suggest that endophyte symbioses in native plants can increase host performance against an invader, although this conclusion needs confirmation in more complex field settings where other important factors, such as herbivores and fluctuating abiotic conditions, come into play.

Symbiont dynamics and strain diversity in the defensive mutualism between Lagria beetles and Burkholderia,"Defensive mutualisms are often facultative in nature, and their evolutionary dynamics can be shaped by changes in local antagonist communities or arms races with coevolving antagonists. Under these conditions, selection may favour hosts that flexibly acquire symbionts producing compounds with bioactivity against current antagonists. Here, we study the prevalence, dynamics and strain diversity of Burkholderia gladioli bacteria in Lagria beetles, a recently described protective symbiosis involving vertical transmission and antifungal defense for the host eggs. In Lagria hirta, we investigate the fate of the bacteria during the host life cycle. Despite a transmission route relying solely on the females, the bacteria are present in both sexes during the larval stage, suggesting a potentially multifaceted defensive role. In L. hirta and L. villosa adults, culture-dependent and -independent techniques revealed that individual beetles harbour diverse Burkholderia strains from at least two different phylogenetic clades, yet all closely related to free-living B. gladioli. Interestingly, rearing the beetles in the laboratory strongly impacted symbiont strain profiles in both beetle species. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of the B. gladioli-Lagria symbiosis and present this as a valuable system for studying multiple strain coinfections, as well as the evolutionary and ecological factors regulating defensive symbiosis.  2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",MA357,KJB,exclude,interspecific,gladioli bacteria-beetles,
Facultative sex ratio adjustment by western bluebird mothers with stay-at-home helpers-at-the-nest,"Although population sex ratios rarely deviate from unity, the sex ratio of individual mothers should be labile, allowing them to bias their sex ratios in favour of the more successful sex when they can expect a difference in the mean reproductive value of their daughters and sons. just how mothers should bias sex allocation is particularly complicated in cooperative breeders, because the adaptive sex ratio may be influenced by conflicting impacts of helpers on their parents' fitness via `local resource enhancement' and `local resource competition'. In western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, breeding-age helpers-at-the-nest are exclusively male and increase their parents' nesting success in the current year. As such, they are viewed as helpers, not hinderers, even though by failing to gain a breeding position they reduce their parents' annual inclusive fitness below that of parents with a breeding son. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that nonbreeding, stay-at-home helpers indicate poor breeding prospects for locally competing sons, and investigated one prediction of this hypothesis that such helpers also indicate a tendency for parents to produce substandard sons. A female removal experiment showed that female mates were in short supply. Pairs had daughter-biased broods when they had a stay-at-home helper son that failed to get a mate in the first place, but not when they had a helper that had been breeding on his own, but returned home to help sometime after his mother finished laying her eggs. Stay-at-home sons were not developmentally delayed relative to breeders of the same cohort, suggesting that helpers may not be inferior to breeders. Although the population sex ratio fluctuates about unity, a multiyear data set showed a negative relationship between the frequency of helping and the annual brood sex ratio for the population. These results suggest that local resource competition outweighs local resource enhancement in driving individual and population sex ratio variation in western bluebirds, a pattern that would not be predicted based on the simple question of whether helpers help or hinder at the nest.

Female home range size is regulated by resource distribution and intraspecific competition: a long-term field study,"The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

Heritable variation in prey defence provides refuge for subdominant predators,"Generalist predators with broadly overlapping niches commonly coexist on seemingly identical sets of prey. Here, we provide empirical demonstration that predators can differentially exploit fine-grained niches generated by variable, heritable and selective defences within a single prey species. Some, but not all, clones of the aphid Aphis craccivora are toxic towards the dominant invasive predatory ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis. However, other less competitive ladybeetle species are not affected by the aphid's toxic trait. In laboratory and open field experiments, we show: (i) that subdominant ladybeetle species were able to exploit the toxic aphids, benefitting from the suppression of the dominant predator; and (ii) that this narrow-spectrum toxicity can function as an anti-predator defence for the aphid, but depends on enemy community context. Our results demonstrate that niche differentiation among generalist predators may hinge upon previously underappreciated heritable variation in prey defence, which, in turn, may promote diversity and stability of enemy communities invaded by a dominant predator.",MA175,KJB,include,interspecific,Predator-prey,"not sure if variation also shifts the interaction, but worth scanning through the paper!"
Inducible defence and the social evolution of herd immunity,"Many organisms vary their level of investment in defensive characters. Protective traits may be induced upon exposure to predators or parasites. In a similar way, humans vaccinate in response to threatening epidemics. When most group members defend themselves, epidemics die out quickly because parasites cannot spread. A high level of group (herd) immunity is therefore beneficial to the group. There is, however, a well-known divergence between the optimum degree of induction for selfish individuals and the level of induction that maximizes group benefit. I develop two optimality models for the frequency of induction. The first model shows that higher relatedness favours more induction and a smaller difference between selfish and cooperative optima. The second model assumes variation in the vigour of individuals and therefore differences in the relative cost for induction. The model predicts that strong individuals induce more easily than weak individuals. Small differences in vigour cause a large divergence in the optimal levels of induction for strong and weak individuals. The concept of genetic relatedness in an evolutionary model is analogous to correlated interests and correlated strategies in an economic model of human behaviour. The evolutionary models presented here therefore provide a basis for further study of human vaccination.",MA204,KJB,include,interspecific,"Host-parasite, modelling","Last part seems most interesting: small differences in vigour leading to differences in optimal level of induction.

Some evolutionary aspects of the food-procuring group behavior in phylogenesis of primates,"The peculiarities were studied of the intragroup competitive and cooperative behavior of primates differing by the level of phylogenetic development, beginning from low-organized species of the higher primates to high-organized anthropoid monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Cebus apella, Macaca mulatto, Papio hamaofrijas, Pan troglodytes). It has been shown that in all monkeys, under conditions of competitive feeding situation, there were changes of the complex behavioral forms observed at individual learning. Under conditions of the activity in pairs, the females of platyrrhine (New World) and lower narrow-nose (Old World) monkeys lost the possibility to realize the skill and food needs, so the programmed tasks were solved predominantly by the males. In chimpanzees, the change of indices of instrumental activity involved to the equal degree the male and female, and solution of the alternation task was higher in individual experiments. The age differences were revealed in the competitive behavior of chimpanzees in group.

Feeding repellence in Antarctic bryozoans,"The Antarctic sea star Odontaster validus and the amphipod Cheirimedon femoratus are important predators in benthic communities. Some bryozoans are part of the diet of the asteroid and represent both potential host biosubstrata and prey for this omnivorous lysianassid amphipod. In response to such ecological pressure, bryozoans are expected to develop strategies to deter potential predators, ranging from physical to chemical mechanisms. However, the chemical ecology of Antarctic bryozoans has been scarcely studied. In this study we evaluated the presence of defenses against predation in selected species of Antarctic bryozoans. The sympatric omnivorous consumers O. validus and C. femoratus were selected to perform feeding assays with 16 ether extracts (EE) and 16 butanol extracts (BE) obtained from 16 samples that belonged to 13 different bryozoan species. Most species (9) were active (12 EE and 1 BE) in sea star bioassays. Only 1 BE displayed repellence, indicating that repellents against the sea star are mainly lipophilic. Repellence toward C. femoratus was found in all species in different extracts (10 EE and 12 BE), suggesting that defenses against the amphipod might be both lipophilic and hydrophilic. Interspecific and intraspecific variability of bioactivity was occasionally detected, suggesting possible environmental inductive responses, symbiotic associations, and/or genetic variability. Multivariate analysis revealed similarities among species in relation to bioactivities of EE and/or BE. These findings support the hypothesis that, while in some cases alternative chemical or physical mechanisms may also provide protection, repellent compounds play an important role in Antarctic bryozoans as defenses against predators.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA145,KJB,exclude,,,
Marine chemical ecology: What's known and what's next?,"In this review, I summarize recent developments in marine chemical ecology and suggest additional studies that should be especially productive. Direct tests in both the field and laboratory show that secondary metabolites commonly function as defenses against consumers. However, some metabolites also diminish fouling, inhibit competitors or microbial pathogens, and serve as gamete attractants; these alternative functions are less thoroughly investigated. We know little about how consumers perceive secondary metabolites or how ecologically realistic doses of defensive metabolites affect consumer physiology or fitness, as opposed to feeding behavior. Secondary metabolites have direct consequences, but they do not act in isolation from other prey characteristics or from the physical and biological environment in which organisms interact with their natural enemies. This mandates that marine chemical ecology be better integrated into a broader and more complex framework that includes aspects of physiological, population, community, and even ecosystem ecology. Recent advances in this area involve assessing how chemically mediated interactions are affected by physical factors such as flow, desiccation, UV radiation, and nutrient availability, or by biological forces such as the palatability or defenses of neighbors, fouling organisms, or microbial symbionts. Chemical defenses can vary dramatically among geographic regions, habitats, individuals within a local habitat, and within different portions of the same individual. Factors affecting this variance are poorly known, but include physical stresses and induction due to previous attack. Studies are needed to assess which consumers induce prey defenses, how responses vary in environments with differing physical characteristics, and whether the `induced' responses are a direct response to consumer attack or are a defense against microbial pathogens invading via feeding wounds. Although relatively unstudied, ontogenetic shifts in concentrations and types of defenses occur in marine species, and patterns of larval chemical defenses appear to provide insights into the evolution of complex life cycles and of differing modes of development among marine invertebrates. The chemical ecology of marine microbes is vastly underappreciated even though microbes produce metabolites that can have devastating indirect effects on non-target organisms (e.g., red tide related fish kills) and significantly affect entire ecosystems. The natural functions of these metabolites are poorly understood, but they appear to deter both consumers and other microbes. Additionally, marine macro-organisms use metabolites from microbial symbionts to deter consumers, subdue prey, and defend their embryos from pathogens. Microbial chemical ecology offers unlimited possibilities for investigators that develop rigorous and more ecologically relevant approaches.",MA240,KJB,exclude,,,
Prey size and scramble vs. contest competition in a social spider: implications for population dynamics,"1. There are many benefits of group living, but also substantial costs, one of which is competition for resources. How scarce food resources are distributed among different members of a population or social group -whether via scramble or contest competition - can influence not only the variance in individual fitness, but also the stability and therefore survival of the group or population. 2. Attributes of the food resources themselves, such as their size, may influence the type of intraspecific competition that occurs and therefore the intrinsic stability of a group or population. 3. By experimentally manipulating the size of prey fed to artificial colonies of the social spider Anelosimus eximius, we investigated whether prey size could alter the degree of scramble vs. contest competition that takes place and, thus, potentially influence colony population dynamics. 4. We found that large prey were shared more evenly than small prey and that individuals in poor condition were more likely to feed when prey were large than when prey were small. Additionally, we show that individuals participating in prey capture are also more likely to feed on the captured prey. 5. We developed a simple mathematical model to explore the prey sizes that would be energetically worth defending, i.e. prey that are `economically defendable'. The model shows that neither very small prey, nor prey above a certain size is worth monopolizing, with only intermediate size prey being `economically defendable'. We therefore suggest the small and large prey in our experiment corresponds to our model's intermediate and large prey categories, respectively. 6. As the size of prey captured by social spider colonies increases with colony size, our findings suggest that scramble competition may predominate in large colonies. Scramble competition, combined with the fact that prey biomass per capita declines as colonies grow beyond a certain size, would then explain why extremely large colonies of this social spider may suddenly go extinct. Our project thus illustrates the potential triple link between characteristics of the resources, individual behaviour and population dynamics, a link rarely considered in an empirical setting.",MA293,KJB,include,interspecific,"Predator-prey, competition, experiment, modelling",
Communal singing in the cooperatively breeding subdesert mesite Monias benschi: Evidence of numerical assessment?,"It has long been suggested that competing groups of social animals assess one another on the basis of communal vocalisations, but so far this has only been demonstrated in mammals. We investigated this idea in the subdesert mesite, a group-living bird that produces communal songs during aggressive territorial interactions with other groups. Where groups compete as units, differences in group size might outweigh inter-individual differences in determining the outcome of contests. Given this species' variable social system, we predicted that the composition of groups would also influence their resource holding potential. Playback experiments showed that the number of simulated intruders significantly influenced the strength of response by defending groups hearing the stimulus: groups were less likely to approach but gave more protracted and more communal vocal responses as the number of vocalising intruders increased. We found that the likelihood of a group approaching playback increased as the ratio between the number of males in the defending group and the number of males in the intruding group increased. Furthermore, the ratio of adult males to females in the defending group significantly affected the probability of approach, with the probability increasing as groups became more male-biased. This finding supports the idea that the social structure of groups may be important in determining the outcome of contests between groups. Overall this study provides some indication in birds of relative numerical assessment based on vocal cues.",MA55,KJB,include,intraspecific,"competition, experiment",Doubting
Mycorrhizal symbiosis and plant reproduction,"Reproduction is an essential function of all organisms and, for many crop species, reproductive structures are the principle edible parts. Still, relatively little is known about the effects of the mycorrhizal symbiosis on host plant reproduction. Common limitations to reproduction include nutrient deficiency, herbivory and disease, and mycorrhizal fungi can influence each of these. Several aspects of sexual reproduction may be influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi including the timing of reproductive events, the number of inflorescences per plant, the number of flowers per inflorescence, the amount of pollen per flower, the proportion of flowers producing fruits, and the number of seeds per fruit. Seed quality can also be strongly influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi, resulting in variation in seedling vigor and resultant competitive ability. Because infection by mycorrhizal fungi can influence interactions among plants, it may lead to variation among individuals in their contributions to the next generation and, therefore, may control the genetic structures of populations and communities.

The forager's dilemma: Food sharing and food defense as risk-sensitive foraging options,"Although many variants of the hawk-dove game predict the frequency at which group foraging animals should compete aggressively, none of them can explain why a large number of group foraging animals share food clumps without any overt aggression. One reason for this shortcoming is that hawk-dove games typically consider only a single contest, while most group foraging situations involve opponents that interact repeatedly over discovered food clumps. The present iterated hawk-dove game predicts that in situations that are analogous to a prisoner's dilemma, animals should share the resources without aggression, provided that the number of simultaneously available food clumps is sufficiently large and the number of competitors is relatively small. However, given that the expected gain of an aggressive animal is more variable than the gain expected by nonaggressive individuals, the predicted effect of the number of food items in a clump-clump richness-depends on whether only the mean or both the mean and variability associated with payoffs are considered. More precisely, the deterministic game predicts that aggression should increase with clump richness, whereas the stochastic risk-sensitive game predicts that the frequency of encounters resulting in aggression should peak at intermediate clump richnesses or decrease with increasing clump richness if animals show sensitivity to the variance or coefficient of variation, respectively.",MA376,KJB,include,interspecific,"modelling, competition",Variation in food items might induce variation in optimal foraging behaviour (and competition behaviour) of predators.
"Spider mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) mitochondrial COI phylogeny reviewed: Host plant relationships, phylogeography, reproductive parasites and barcoding","The past 15 years have witnessed a number of molecular studies that aimed to resolve issues of species delineation and phylogeny of mites in the family Tetranychidae. The central part of the mitochondrial COI region has frequently been used for investigating intra- and interspecific variation. All these studies combined yield an extensive database of sequence information of the family Tetranychidae. We assembled this information in a single alignment and performed an overall phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogeny shows that important patterns have been overlooked in previous studies, whereas others disappear. It also reveals that mistakes were made in submitting the data to GenBank, which further disturbed interpretation of the data. Our total analysis clearly shows three clades that most likely correspond to the species T. urticae, T. kanzawai and T. truncatus. Intraspecific variation is very high, possibly due to selective sweeps caused by reproductive parasites. We found no evidence for host plant associations and phylogeographic patterns in T. urticae are absent. Finally we evaluate the application of DNA barcoding.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",MA349,KJB,exclude,,,
"Mutualism, market effects and partner control","Intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism often feature a marked asymmetry in the scope for exploitation. Cooperation may nevertheless persist despite one-sided opportunities for cheating, provided that the partner vulnerable to exploitation has sufficient control over the duration of interaction. The effectiveness of the threat of terminating an encounter, however, depends upon the ease with which both the potential victim and the potential exploiter can find replacement partners. Here, we extend a simple, game-theoretical model of this form of partner control to incorporate variation in the relative abundance of potential victims and exploiters, which leads to variation in the time required for individuals of each type to find a new partner. We show that such market effects have a dramatic influence on the stable level of exploitation (and consequent duration of interaction). As the relative abundance of victims decreases, they become less tolerant to exploitation, terminating encounters earlier (for a given level of exploitation), whereas exploiters behave in a more cooperative manner. As a result, the stable duration of interaction actually increases, despite the decreasing tolerance of the victims. Below a critical level of relative victim abundance, the model suggests that the cost of finding a replacement partner becomes so great that it does not pay to exploit at all.",MA252,KJB,include,intraspecific,"competition, modelling, cheating",
"Male dominance relationships in an extremely large chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda","Male dominance hierarchies occur in many group-living primates and some non-primate mammals. Variation in aspects of agonistic relationships such as how many dyads show bidirectionality in aggression leads to variation in dominance hierarchies along a continuum from egalitarian (relatively small agonistic power differences between adjacently-ranked individuals, shallow hierarchies) to despotic (relatively large differences, steep hierarchies). Ranks usually depend mostly or entirely on individual characteristics that influence fighting ability (e.g., body size) and show inverse-U shaped relationships to age. However, coalitionary support sometimes also influences ranks. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) form multi-male, multi-female communities within which males compete for status. Males typically form dominance hierarchies, and data from multiple study show that rank is positively related to paternity success. Males also often form coalitions and some dyads form long-term alliances. Effective coalitionary support can help individuals improve and maintain their ranks, and some evidence supports the hypothesis that coalitionary aggression generally, and the positions that males hold in coalitions networks specifically, influences paternity success. Hierarchy steepness varies among communities and within communities over time; variation in the number of prime-aged males per community is a likely source of this variation. Long-term data from an extremely large chimpanzee community with unusually many males, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, are largely consistent with previous analyses of male chimpanzee dominance hierarchies, but show several notable contrasts. Males at Ngogo formed significantly linear hierarchies and hierarchy steepness was greater than expected if the outcomes of agonistic interactions were random. However, variation in steepness did not show the significant inverse relationship to the number of ``prime-aged{''} males documented for other chimpanzee communities and average steepness was high given the large number of males. Ranks showed an inverse-U shaped relationship to age, although individual rank trajectories varied considerably, but males attained their highest lifetime ranks at later ages and maintained relatively high ranks to later ages than those at other chimpanzee research sites. Two measures of coalition networks, strength and Bonacich power, showed significant positive relationships with male ranks. Strength is the rate at which males joined coalitions. Bonacich power is a measure of network centrality that assesses a male's relational power, or influence (Bonacich, 1987): a male with high Bonacich power formed coalitions with relatively many other males who were also central in the coalition network, i.e., he was strongly connected to powerful others. On average, males also attained maximum values for these and other network measures relatively late and maintained relatively high values to relatively late ages. High coalition network strength, Bonacich power, and eigenvector centrality early in adulthood were associated with high peak ranks at later ages. However, the direction of causality between participation in coalition networks and ranks is not yet clear, and the effects of body size on dominance ranks and individual rank trajectories remains to be explored. Ngogo is a favourable habitat for chimpanzees and survivorship there is unusually high; this presumably facilitates the ability of males to maintain high competitive ability longer than at other sites and shifts rank trajectories toward older ages and leads to relatively steep hierarchies despite the fact that many male dyads have similar competitive ability. Future work will assess the impact of coalitions on dominance relationships in more detail and the relationship of coalitionary aggression to paternity success.",MA234,KJB,exclude,,,
Social behaviour and gut microbiota in red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer): In search of the role of immunity in the evolution of sociality,"Vertebrate gut microbiota form a key component of immunity and a dynamic link between an individual and the ecosystem. Microbiota might play a role in social systems as well, because microbes are transmitted during social contact and can affect host behaviour. Combining methods from behavioural and molecular research, we describe the relationship between social dynamics and gut microbiota of a group-living cooperative species of primate, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Specifically, we ask whether patterns of social contact (group membership, group size, position in social network, individual sociality) are associated with patterns of gut microbial composition (diversity and similarity) between individuals and across time. Red-bellied lemurs were found to have gut microbiota with slight temporal fluctuations and strong social group-specific composition. Contrary to expectations, individual sociality was negatively associated with gut microbial diversity. However, position within the social network predicted gut microbial composition. These results emphasize the role of the social environment in determining the microbiota of adult animals. Since social transmission of gut microbiota has the potential to enhance immunity, microbiota might have played an escalating role in the evolution of sociality.  2017 The Authors.

Complement of integrated fertilizer management and integrated pest management concepts to ameliorate faba bean growth and yield [Ergnzung des integrierten dngungs und krankheitsmanagements zur verbesserung des wachstums und ertrags von ackerbohnen],"Twenty-one microbial preparations recommended for controlling pathogenic fungal strains causing root rot and wilt diseases of faba bean were investigated for antibiosis against several symbiotic and associative diazotrophs adopting a modified agar-plate-inhibition-zone assay. Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium exhibited a somewhat similar susceptibility to biocontrol agents while associative diazotrophs showed variable responses. Azotobacter, compared to others, was severely inhibited by such bio-candidates. The members of the biofertilizer formulation Biofertan did bear mixed cultivation with the majority of biocontrol agents. Among those, Bacillus subtilis was deemed the pioneer. In pot experiments, almost all the antagonists significantly restricted the severity of root rot and wilt diseases besides modifying faba bean seedling stand and improving plant development. This was very obvious with shoot biomass increases of >50%. Moreover, the bioagents successfully recovered the legume establishment, seriously injured due to pathogenic fungal infection. Simultaneous inoculation with Rhizobium and biocontrol agents provided more growth stimulation compared to either when introduced individually. Field-grown faba beans were inoculated with the diazotroph and representatives of biocontrol strains by two different methods, seed coating and over-head soil. Growth parameters determined were the highest when the legume plant was seed-coated by Rhizobium simultaneously over-head soil inoculated with the bacterial bioagents; this was reported with Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aerugenosa. The significance of combined application of biofertilizer and bioagent to ensure cheap, clean and safe farm products is discussed.  2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",MA65,KJB,exclude,,,
Modelling the co-evolution of indirect genetic effects and inherited variability,"When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies, however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture. Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal individual and of the difference in trait value between the social partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection. Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases, i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller. Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.",MA245,KJB,include,intraspecific,modelling,based on the abstract it is hard to see whether there might be some relevant results in the paper.
Competition in a group of equal foragers,"Using techniques from renewal process theory, we build a stochastic model for gain accumulation in a group of equal competitors foraging in a patchy environment. The model for gain of the individuals is based on the waiting times between subsequent prey encounters by the group. These waiting times depend on the number of foragers in the group. A single parameter of this dependency encompasses a variety of foraging scenarios, from cooperation to scramble. With constant patch size, correlations between gains of any pair of foragers are negative. This dependency is most intense in small groups. Increased variation in patch size makes correlations in gains between group members positive irrespective of the group size. For a solitary forager, variance in gain approaches zero with increasing time in the patch. For an individual member in a group, variance grows monotonically. Thus, depending on the patch departure rule controlling the time to be spent in the patch, solitary foragers may have a smaller variance in gain than members in a group. As solitary foragers also potentially harvest all prey in the patch, it is hard to believe that grouping behavior would evolve solely on the basis of foraging.",MA61,KJB,exclude,intraspecific,modelling,
"Behavioural and Hormonal Stress Responses to Social Separation in Ravens, Corvus corax","Social life is profitable, but it facilitates conflicts over resources and creates interdependence between individuals. Separating highly social animals triggers intense reactions aimed at re-establishing lost connections. Less is known, however, about behavioural and physiological responses to separation in socially facultative species, where individuals temporarily form groups and may subsequently leave them. Non-breeding common ravens (Corvus corax) gather in large numbers at feeding and roosting sites, but otherwise spend time seemingly solitary or in small subgroups. We here studied how ravens cope with being socially isolated, and investigated the life characteristics that might explain potential individual differences. For this, we individually separated captive subadult ravens (n=25) and housed them in physical and visual isolation from their group members across 4d. During the separation period, we collected behavioural data and measured the amount of immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites from bird droppings to assess the ravens physiological stress response. We found behavioural indicators of stress at the start of the separation, when ravens showed higher levels of tension than of comfort  a pattern that reversed at the end of the separation. Furthermore, we found that the upbringing of ravens affected their behaviour during separation. Hand-raised birds produced more vocalisations in the beginning of the separation, and were less active at the end, while the reverse pattern occurred with parent-raised ravens. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find differences in hormonal responses between the beginning and end of the separation period or any link between hormonal responses and behaviours. Ravens behavioural responses to social separation stress seem to be dependent on their arousal states, although possible links with hormonal reactions remain unclear. Our results show that behavioural reactions are not always linked with hormonal responses to stress, and further emphasise the importance of investigating effects of early-life experiences.  2016 The Authors.

Selfish Mitonuclear Conflict,"Mitochondria, a nearly ubiquitous feature of eukaryotes, are derived from an ancient symbiosis. Despite billions of years of cooperative coevolution  in what is arguably the most important mutualism in the history of life  the persistence of mitochondrial genomes also creates conditions for genetic conflict with the nucleus. Because mitochondrial genomes are present in numerous copies per cell, they are subject to both within- and among-organism levels of selection. Accordingly, selfish genotypes that increase their own proliferation can rise to high frequencies even if they decrease organismal fitness. It has been argued that uniparental (often maternal) inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes evolved to curtail such selfish replication by minimizing within-individual variation and, hence, within-individual selection. However, uniparental inheritance creates conditions for cytonuclear conflict over sex determination and sex ratio, as well as conditions for sexual antagonism when mitochondrial variants increase transmission by enhancing maternal fitness but have the side-effect of being harmful to males (i.e., mother's curse). Here, we review recent advances in understanding selfish replication and sexual antagonism in the evolution of mitochondrial genomes and the mechanisms that suppress selfish interactions, drawing parallels and contrasts with other organelles (plastids) and bacterial endosymbionts that arose more recently. Although cytonuclear conflict is widespread across eukaryotes, it can be cryptic due to nuclear suppression, highly variable, and lineage-specific, reflecting the diverse biology of eukaryotes and the varying architectures of their cytoplasmic genomes. Havird et al. explain how mitochondrial and nuclear genomes can come into conflict with one another and how this fits into specific features of organelle/host biology, such as the commonly observed uniparental inheritance of mitochondria.  2019 Elsevier Ltd",MA313,KJB,exclude,,,
Modification of insect and arachnid behaviours by vertically transmitted endosymbionts: Infections as drivers of behavioural change and evolutionary novelty,"Vertically acquired, endosymbiotic bacteria such as those belonging to the Rickettsiales and the Mollicutes are known to influence the biology of their arthropod hosts in order to favour their own transmission. In this study we investigate the influence of such reproductive parasites on the behavior of their insects and arachnid hosts. We find that changes in host behavior that are associated with endosymbiont infections are not restricted to characteristics that are directly associated with reproduction. Other behavioural traits, such as those involved in intraspecific competition or in dispersal may also be affected. Such behavioural shifts are expected to influence the level of intraspecific variation and the rate at which adaptation can occur through their effects on effective population size and gene flow amongst populations. Symbionts may thus influence both levels of polymorphism within species and the rate at which diversification can occur.  2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",MA247,KJB,exclude,,,
"Rates of parasitism, but not allocation of egg resources, vary among and within hosts of a generalist avian brood parasite","Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) deposit their eggs into the nests of other birds, which then raise the cowbird chick. Female cowbirds thus have limited options for impacting their offsprings development via maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact their offsprings phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs. There was no evidence for variation in cowbird egg components among or within host species. Our data indicate that cowbirds discriminate among host nests, but do not appear to adjust the composition of their eggs based on inter- or intraspecific host variation.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA299,KJB,exclude,,,
Developmental plasticity and social specialization in cooperative societies,"Cooperative breeding systems showcase the diversity of social trajectories within and among species, ranging from the extremes of eusocial insects where individuals become irreversibly specialized as fecund queens or sterile workers, to vertebrate systems where individuals maintain the flexibility to breed throughout life. Between these extremes lies a continuum with individuals exhibiting varying degrees of specialization in their behaviour. Most research on cooperative breeders, particularly on vertebrate systems, has focused on why helping has evolved, rather than addressing this diversity. Here, we present a framework to explain variation in the timing, extent and flexibility of phenotypic divergence across vertebrate and invertebrate cooperative systems. We base our framework on recent theory about how individuals integrate information about the environment from different sources (genes, parents and direct experiences) when establishing their developmental trajectory. We discuss how the timing and degree of divergence and specialization are influenced by the availability and reliability of information about later fitness options and by the extent to which individuals have control over their development. Throughout, we use this developmental perspective to draw broad comparisons across vertebrate and invertebrate systems, which are often considered separately.

Hotspots of damage by antagonists shape the spatial structure of plant-pollinator interactions,"The balance between mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions and their spatial variation results in a highly dynamic mosaic of reproductive success within plant populations. Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",MA187,KJB,exclude,,,
Behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology: Unified perspective on personality research,"Behavioral geneticists and evolutionary psychologists have generally pursued human behavioral analyses with little theoretical or methodological exchange. However, significant benefits might accrue from increased communication between these disciplines. The primary goals of this article are (1) to identify meaningful junctures between behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology, (2) to describe behavioral genetic research designs and their applications to evolutionary analyses, and (3) to reassess current personality research in light of behavioral genetic and evolutionary concepts and techniques, The five-factor model of personality is conceptualized as subsuming variation in normative species-typical systems with adaptive functions in the human environment of evolutionary adaptation. Considered as universal evolved mechanisms, personality systems are often seen in dynamic conflict within individuals and as highly compartmentalized in their functioning between settings, However, genetically influenced individual differences in personality may also be understood within an evolutionary framework. Studies of the heritability of personality traits indicate broad-sense heritabilities in the 0.40-0.50 range with evidence of substantial nonadditive genetic variation and nonshared environmental influences. Evidence indicates that evolutionary theory (e.g., inclusive fitness theory) predicts patterns of social interaction (e.g., cooperation and bereavement) in relatives. Furthermore, variation in personality may constitute a range of viable strategies matching the opportunities available in the complex niche environment of human societies. Within this wide range of viable strategies, personality variation functions as a resource environment for individuals in the sense that personality variation is evaluated according to the interests of the evaluator (e.g., friendships, coalitions, or mate choice).",MA30,KJB,exclude,,,
The fundamental role of competition in the ecology and evolution of mutualisms,"Mutualisms are interspecific interactions that yield reciprocal benefits. Here, by adopting a consumer-resource perspective, we show how considering competition is necessary in order to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of mutualism. We first review the ways in which competition shapes the ecology of mutualisms, using a graphical framework based on resource flows rather than net effects to highlight the opportunities for competition. We then describe the known mechanisms of competition and show how it is a critical driver of the evolutionary dynamics, persistence, and diversification of mutualism. We argue that empirical and theoretical research on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms will jointly progress by addressing four key points: (i) the existence and shape of physiological trade-offs among cooperation, competition, and other life-history and functional traits; (ii) the capacity for individuals to express conditional responses to variation in their mutualistic and competitive environment; (iii) the existence of heritable variation for mutualistic and competitive traits and their potentially conditional expression; and (iv) the structure of the network of consumer-resource interactions in which individuals are embedded.",MA377,KJB,include,interspecific,review,
Natural and human economies compared,"Human economies and natural ecosystems (natural economies) share fundamental properties. Both are adaptive, cooperative systems where agents-individuals and groups-compete for locally limiting resources needed to live and reproduce. Successful competitors differentially propagate better knowledge and technology for making a living. Competition has favored innovations, diversification (of species or human occupations), higher productivity, greater interdependence among economic agents, and the emergence of more powerful, interactive individuals and groups, so productivity, diversity, and scales of activity have tended to increase over time. Because economic innovations accumulate, these trends have accelerated over time in both natural and human economies. The shift from mainly genetic origin and transmission of adaptation in natural economies to mainly cultural adaptation among human beings has accelerated these trends dramatically, and made the modern human economy extraordinarily dependent on nonrenewable resources and much more vulnerable to monopolies and tragedies of the commons, internally generated threats less common or less destructive in natural economies. In nature, these internal disruptions are overcome by the advent of new agents, often not involved in causing these disruptions, that compete in new ways. We argue that a comparable shift in societal norms, which govern individual and group status in human society, is needed to keep monopolies and tragedies of the commons from harming both the human economy and the ecosystems on which we depend.  2011 Vermeij and Leigh.",MA255,KJB,exclude,,,
"The origins of consistent individual differences in cooperation in wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo","Individual differences in contributions to cooperation can be strikingly consistent over time giving rise to alternative cooperative phenotypes within animal societies. Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as `breeders' and `nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and `escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study of wild baboons,"For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals social relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50% of live-born females and c. 44% of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood, both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation (i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming) are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast, in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in the particulars of their social environment.  2018 The Authors.

"Fitness costs of phoretic nematodes in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides","Nicrophorusvespilloides is a social beetle that rears its offspring on decomposing carrion. Wild beetles are frequently associated with two types of macrobial symbionts, mites, and nematodes. Although these organisms are believed to be phoretic commensals that harmlessly use beetles as a means of transfer between carcasses, the role of these symbionts on N.vespilloides fitness is poorly understood. Here, we show that nematodes have significant negative effects on beetle fitness across a range of worm densities and also quantify the density-dependent transmission of worms between mating individuals and from parents to offspring. Using field-caught beetles, we provide the first report of a new nematode symbiont in N.vespilloides, most closely related to Rhabditoides regina, and show that worm densities are highly variable across individuals isolated from nature but do not differ between males and females. Next, by inoculating mating females with increasing densities of nematodes, we show that worm infections significantly reduce brood size, larval survival, and larval mass, and also eliminate the trade-off between brood size and larval mass. Finally, we show that nematodes are efficiently transmitted between mating individuals and from mothers to larvae, directly and indirectly via the carcass, and that worms persist through pupation. These results show that the phoretic nematode R.regina can be highly parasitic to burying beetles but can nevertheless persist because of efficient mechanisms of intersexual and intergenerational transmission. Phoretic species are exceptionally common and may cause significant harm to their hosts, even though they rely on these larger species for transmission to new resources. However, this harm may be inevitable and unavoidable if transmission of phoretic symbionts requires nematode proliferation. It will be important to determine the generality of our results for other phoretic associates of animals. It will equally be important to assess the fitness effects of phoretic species under changing resource conditions and in the field where diverse interspecific interactions may exacerbate or reduce the negative effects of phoresy.  2018 The Authors.

Recombination and selection shape the molecular diversity pattern of nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium sp associated to Medicago,"We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample, from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species, within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes. Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus, recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different loci.",MA300,KJB,exclude,,,
Individual variation behind the evolution of cooperation,"Life on Earth has two remarkable properties. The first is variation: even apart from the vast number of extant species, there are considerable differences between individuals within a single species. The second property is cooperation. It is surprising that until recently the interactions between these two properties have rarely been addressed from an evolutionary point of view. Here, I concentrate on how inter-individual differences influence the evolution of cooperation. First, I deal with cases where individuality is maintained by random processes like mutation or phenotypic noise. Second, I examine when differences in state cause differences in behaviour. Finally, I investigate the effects of individual role specialization. Variation can be important in several ways. Increased random variation can change the expectation about cooperativeness of future partners, altering behaviour in a current relationship. Differences in state may serve as a book-keeping mechanism that is necessary for the evolution of reciprocity. If the cost of cooperation can depend on state then strategic regulation of state makes it possible to coerce partners to cooperate. If conditions force individuals to specialize, cooperation becomes more valuable. My review of theoretical models suggests that variation plays an important role in the evolution of cooperation.",MA201,KJB,include,intraspecific,"theoretical, review",most important one so far
First evidence for the joint dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi and plant diaspores by birds,"Seed dispersal allows plants to colonise new sites and escape from pathogens and intraspecific competition, maintaining plant genetic diversity and regulating plant distribution. Conversely, most plant species form mutualistic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a symbiosis established immediately after seed germination. Because AM fungi are obligate symbionts, using the same dispersal vector as their host should be highly advantageous for their survival, but the co-dispersal of seeds and AM fungal spores has never been confirmed. We aim to clarify the potential role of European birds, essential dispersers for many plant species, as co-dispersers of seeds and AM fungal spores. In total, 63 bird droppings with intact seeds were placed in sterilised soil and maintained for 4months in a protected environment to avoid contamination. Additionally, 173 bird droppings and 729 gauze swabs used to clean birds feet were inspected for AM fungal spores. Although no spores were detected by direct observation of these samples, seven Rubus ulmifolius seedlings obtained from four independent droppings of Erithacus rubecula and Sylvia melanocephala were colonised by AM fungi. Our results show that birds can effectively co-disperse viable seeds and AM fungal spores, potentially over long distances, providing a pivotal mechanism to understand the cosmopolitan distribution of AM fungi.  2018 The Authors.

On the reorganization of fitness during evolutionary transitions in individuality,"The basic problem in an evolutionary transition is to understand how a group of individuals becomes a new kind of individual, possessing the property of heritable variation in fitness at the new level of organization. During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual. We use the volvocalean green algal group as a model-system to understand evolutionary transitions in individuality and to apply and test the theoretical principles presented above. Lastly, we discuss how the different notions of individuality stem from the basic properties of fitness in a multilevel selection context.",MA263,KJB,include,intraspecific,"evolution of multicellularity, experiment",probably irrelevant
Benefiting friends or dominants: prosocial choices mainly depend on rank position in long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis),"Long-term observational studies in a number of animal species suggest that exchange patterns of social acts depend on long-term emotional bonds. Therefore, it is expected that the frequency of prosocial behavior will depend on the strength of such a bond. In this study we tested whether variation in relationship quality among unrelated individuals, i.e., ``friends{''} and ``nonfriends,{''} is predictive of the prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques in two experiments. First, we related relationship quality to prosociality in a dyadic prosociality test, and second, we gave subjects the choice to give to either a friend or a nonfriend in a triadic choice test. We show that prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques in the dyadic test is not related to relationship quality. When given the choice to give to either a friend or a nonfriend in the triadic test, there is a minor indication that long-tailed macaques show a preference to give to their friends, yet this indication is neither significant nor consistent. In contrast, subordinate long-tailed macaques make a more ``competitive{''} choice and avoid giving to the individual closest in rank. Therefore, in the short-term situation of experimental tests, prosocial behavior of long-tailed macaques seems unaffected by the relationship quality of the dyad/triad tested, and the relative dominance position of these dyads/triads seems to have a much stronger effect on their prosocial behavior.",MA33,KJB,include,intraspecific,"experiment, sharing, prosocial behaviour",
Social heterosis and the maintenance of genetic diversity,"Genetic diversity in species is often high in spite of directional selection or strong genetic drift. One resolution to this paradox may be through fitness benefits arising from interactions of genetically diverse individuals. Advantageous phenotypes that are impossible in single individuals (e.g. being simultaneously bold and shy) can be expressed by groups composed of genetically different individuals. Genetic diversity, therefore, can produce mutualistic benefits shared by all group members. We define this effect as 'social heterosis', and mathematically demonstrate maintenance of allelic diversity when diverse groups or neighbourhoods are more reproductively successful than homogenous ones. Through social heterosis, genetic diversity persists without: frequency dependence within groups, migration, balancing selection, genetic linkages, overdominance, antagonistic pleiotropy or nonrandom allele assortment. Social heterosis may also offer an alternative evolutionary pathway to cooperation that does not require clustering of related individuals, nepotistic favouritism towards kin, or overt reciprocity.  2007 The Authors.",MA334,KJB,include,intraspecific,modelling,
Friend or foe: Inter-specific interactions and conflicts of interest within the family,"1. Interactions between species can vary from mutually beneficial to evolutionarily neutral to antagonistic, even when the same two species are involved. Similarly, social interactions between members of the same species can lie on a spectrum from conflict to cooperation. 2. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variation in the two types of social behaviour are interconnected. Is the fitness of the various classes of social partner within species (such as parent and offspring, or male and female) differently affected by interactions with a second species? Moreover, can inter-specific interactions influence the outcome of social interactions within species? 3. The present experiments focus on the interactions between the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides Herbst and the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi G. Canestrini & R. Canestrini. The approach was to measure the fitness of burying beetle mothers, fathers, and offspring after reproduction, which took place either in the presence or absence of mites. 4. We found that male, female, and larval burying beetles derive contrasting fitness costs and benefits from their interactions with the mite, despite sharing a common family environment. From the mite's perspective, its relationship with the burying beetle can, therefore, be simultaneously antagonistic, neutral, and possibly even mutualistic, depending on the particular family member involved. We also found that mites can potentially change the outcome of evolutionary conflicts within the family. 5. We conclude that inter-specific interactions can explain some of the variation in social interactions seen within species. It is further suggested that intra-specific interactions might contribute to variation in the outcome of interactions between species.  2015 The Royal Entomological Society.",MA156,KJB,include,both,"cooperation, experiment",
POLYANDRY REDUCES SPERM LENGTH VARIATION IN SOCIAL INSECTS,"Postcopulatory sexual selection, either in the form of sperm competition or cryptic female choice, is an important selective force that is thought to have generated the enormous variation in sperm morphology observed interspecifically. However, the evolutionary significance of intraspecific variation in sperm morphology, and the role that postcopulatory sexual selection plays in influencing this variation, remains poorly investigated in invertebrates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that postcopulatory sexual selection reduces variation in sperm morphology, both between and within males, in 27 species of eusocial ants and bees. These eusocial species offer an unusual opportunity to assess how selection acts on variance in sperm morphology, as haploid males produce clonal, haploid sperm that does not experience haploid-diploid conflict. We provide solid evidence that males of polyandrous ant and bee species indeed produce less-variable sperm, indicating that sperm competition selected for sperm of superior quality. Our results offer a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of high-quality sperm and provide comprehensive evidence that sperm morphology of social insects is influenced by sexual selection.",MA288,KJB,exclude,,,

"Carapace relative growth of Trapezia Latreille, 1828 (Decapoda, Brachyura), crabs that are symbionts of hard corals, from Clipperton atoll and the Revillagigedo islands: Ecological and zoogeographical implications","Decapod metapopulation dynamics are better understood by confronting theoretical studies with empirical data. In this study, our goal was to analyse the morphometric characteristics and relative growth of the carapace of Trapezia bidentata (Forskl, 1775) and T. digitalis Latreille, 1828, crabs from the islands Clipperton and Revillagigedo, in order to assess the degree of inter- and intraspecific similarity of the four insular populations. We examined 325 specimens and identified four species: T. bidentata (72.9% of total abundance), T. digitalis (23.1%), T. formosa Smith, 1869 (3.4%), and T. corallina Gerstaecker, 1857 (0.6%). Three carapace measurements were taken for each specimen: carapace width (CW), carapace length (CL), and interocular distance (ID). The variables CL and ID were fit to a power equation taking CW as the reference dimension. As in other brachyurans, growth pattern analyses indicated an isometric type in all CW vs CL and CW vs ID relationships examined. Interspecific differences included a larger body size for T. bidentata and larger ID/CW for T. digitalis. Significant intraspecific differences in the two insular populations of T. digitalis were evidenced in the ID/CW ratio. In contrast, populations of T. bidentata were morphometrically closer. These results indicate a higher degree of connectedness of the parts of the T. bidentata metapopulation than of that of T. digitalis, probably due to differences in the duration of their larval stages. We think that the larger body size in T. bidentata might account for competitive advantages in food gathering and habitat selection over the remaining species. In turn, as a counteracting trait for its smaller size, the larger ID might allow T. digitalis a better ability to perceive 3D and to judge relative distances between objects, thus avoiding competitive combats and improving antipredatory or escape responses.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",MA40,KJB,exclude,,,
Molecular evolution patterns reveal life history features of mycoplasma-related endobacteria associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,"The mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE), representing a recently discovered lineage of Mollicutes, are widely distributed across arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota). AMF colonize roots of most terrestrial plants and improve plant mineral nutrient uptake in return for plant-assimilated carbon. The role of MRE in the biology of their fungal hosts is unknown. To start characterizing this association, we assessed partitioning of MRE genetic diversity within AMF individuals and across the AMF phylogeographic range. We further used molecular evolution patterns to make inferences about MRE codivergence with AMF, their lifestyle and antiquity of the Glomeromycota-MRE association. While we did not detect differentiation between MRE derived from different continents, high levels of diversity were apparent in MRE populations within AMF host individuals. MRE exhibited significant codiversification with AMF over ecological time and the absence of codivergence over evolutionary time. Moreover, genetic recombination was evident in MRE. These patterns indicate that, while MRE transmission is predominantly vertical, their complex intrahost populations are likely generated by horizontal transmission and recombination. Based on predictions of evolutionary theory, we interpreted these observations as a suggestion that MRE may be antagonists of AMF. Finally, we detected a marginally significant signature of codivergence of MRE with Glomeromycota and the Endogone lineage of Mucoromycotina, implying that the symbiosis between MRE and fungi may predate the divergence between these two groups of fungi.",MA249,KJB,exclude,,,
Collective action problem in heterogeneous groups,"I review the theoretical and experimental literature on the collective action problem in groups whose members differ in various characteristics affecting individual costs, benefits and preferences in collective actions. I focus on evolutionary models that predict how individual efforts and fitnesses, group efforts and the amount of produced collective goods depend on the groups size and heterogeneity, as well as on the benefit and cost functions and parameters. I consider collective actions that aim to overcome the challenges from nature or win competition with neighbouring groups of co-specifics. I show that the largest contributors towards production of collective goods will typically be group members with the highest stake in it or for whom the effort is least costly, or those who have the largest capability or initial endowment. Under some conditions, such group members end up with smaller net pay-offs than the rest of the group. That is, they effectively behave as altruists. With weak nonlinearity in benefit and cost functions, the group effort typically decreases with group size and increases with within-group heterogeneity. With strong nonlinearity in benefit and cost functions, these patterns are reversed. I discuss the implications of theoretical results for animal behaviour, human origins and psychology.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Plant-animal mutualism in biological markets: Evolutionary and ecological dynamics driven by non-heritable phenotypic variance,"Mutualism between plants and animals, such as in pollination and seed dispersal, is a fundamental mechanism facilitating the productivity and biodiversity of ecosystems, and it is often considered as an analog of a free-market economy. The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Policing and punishment across the domains of social evolution,"Several decades of research in humans, other vertebrates, and social insects have offered fascinating insights into the dynamics of punishment (and its subset, policing), but authors have only rarely addressed whether there are fundamental joint principles underlying the maintenance of these behaviors. Here we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punishing roles in animal societies. We apply our scheme to societies of eusocial Hymenoptera and nonhuman vertebrate social breeders, and we outline potential extensions for understanding conflict regulation among cells in metazoan bodies and unrelated individuals in human societies. We highlight that: 1) no social unit is expected to express punishment behavior unless it collects positive inclusive fitness benefits that surpass alternative benefits of bystanding; 2) punishment with public good benefits can be maintained through either direct fitness benefits (coercion) or indirect fitness benefits (correction) or both; 3) differences across social systems in the distributions of power, relatedness, and reproductive options drive variation in the extent to which individuals actively punish; and 4) inclusive fitness logic captures many punishment-relevant evolutionary and ecological variables in a single framework that appears to apply across very different types of social arrangements. Synthesis Researchers have long observed that individuals in animal societies punish (and by extension, police) each other, but they have rarely investigated whether general principles underlie this behavior across social arrangements. In this paper, we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punisher roles in animal societies. We apply the approach to eusocial insects and cooperatively breeding vertebrates and outline extensions towards the control of cancer cell lineages and punishment in human groups.

Cooperation and conflict in the evolution of multicellularity,"Multicellular organisms probably originated as groups of cells formed in several ways, including cell proliferation from a group of founder cells and aggregation. Cooperation among cells benefits the group, but may be costly (altruistic) or beneficial (synergistic) to individual cooperating cells. In this paper, we study conflict mediation, the process by which genetic modifiers evolve that enhance cooperation by altering the parameters of development or rules of formation of cell groups. We are particularly interested in the conditions under which these modifiers lead to a new higher-level unit of selection with increased cooperation among group members and heritable variation in fitness at the group level. By sculpting the fitness variation and opportunity for selection at the two levels, conflict modifiers create new functions at the organism level. An organism is more than a group of cooperating cells related by common descent; organisms require adaptations that regulate conflict within. Otherwise their continued evolution is frustrated by the: creation of within-organism variation and conflict between levels of selection. The evolution of conflict modifiers is a necessary prerequisite to the emergence of individuality and the continued well being of the organism. Conflict leads - through the evolution of adaptations that reduce it - to greater individuality and harmony for the organism.",MA78,KJB,include,intraspecific,"evolution of multicellularity, modelling",
Host-parasite dynamics lead to mixed cooperative games,"Although the Prisoner's dilemma is a leading metaphor for the evolution of sociality, only a few studies demonstrate that this game indeed operates in nature. We offer an alternative perspective, in which parasites and their hosts are used as a model system, suggesting that Prisoner's dilemma may be rare due to different individuals experiencing variation in the payoffs they receive from alternative strategies. Ectoparasites (such as fleas) move stochastically between hosts, causing differential parasite burdens. The resulting variance in the need for cooperation - in this case cooperative allogrooming - means that payoffs for different strategies (e.g. cooperate and defect) are not fixed. Our simulations revealed that due to parasite dynamics, cooperation among hosts conforms to a mixture of two games: Mutualism and Cruel Bind, both of which are more likely to coerce individuals into mutual cooperation than Prisoner's dilemma. Though interesting, Prisoner's dilemma is in fact the least likely scenario. If payoff variation is common, the dominance of the Prisoner's dilemma paradigm may have made us unnecessarily puzzled by cooperation in nature.",MA183,KJB,include,interspecific,modelling,
Conflicting selection in the course of adaptive diversification: The interplay between mutualism and intraspecific competition,"Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency- dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems. Hence, different processes, such as trait convergence favoring the incorporation of nonrelated species, are needed to explain the higher richness of low-intimacy assemblages-shown here to be up to 1 order of magnitude richer than high-intimacy systems.  2014 by The University of Chicago.",MA71,KJB,include,intraspecific,modelling,Focuses more on the effects of variation on the potential for adaptation.

Intraspecific competition impacts Vibrio fischeri strain diversity during initial colonization of the squid light organ,"Animal development and physiology depend on beneficial interactions with microbial symbionts. In many cases, the microbial symbionts are horizontally transmitted among hosts, thereby making the acquisition of these microbes from the environment an important event within the life history of each host. The light organ symbiosis established between the Hawaiian squid Euprymna scolopes and the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri is a model system for examining how hosts acquire horizontally transmitted microbial symbionts. Recent studies have revealed that the light organ of wild-caught E. scolopes squid contains polyclonal populations of V. fischeri bacteria; however, the function and development of such strain diversity in the symbiosis are unknown. Here, we report our phenotypic and phylogenetic characterizations of FQ-A001, which is a V. fischeri strain isolated directly from the light organ of an E. scolopes individual. Relative to the type strain ES114, FQ-A001 exhibits similar growth in rich medium but displays increased bioluminescence and decreased motility in soft agar. FQ-A001 outcompetes ES114 in colonizing the crypt spaces of the light organs. Remarkably, we find that animals cocolonized with FQ-A001 and ES114 harbor singly colonized crypts, in contrast to the cocolonized crypts observed from competition experiments involving single genotypes. The results with our two-strain system suggest that strain diversity within the squid light organ is a consequence of diversity in the single-strain colonization of individual crypt spaces.  2016, American Society for Microbiology.",MA219,KJB,exclude,,,
"Individual versus social complexity, with particular reference to ant colonies","Insect societies - colonies of ants, bees, wasps and termites vary enormously in their social complexity. Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategics and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species arc less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies arc characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.",MA203,KJB,include,intraspecific,"review, eusocial insects",Not sure (again)
Cell communities and robustness in development,"The robustness of patterning events in development is a key feature that must be accounted for in proposed models of these events. When considering explicitly cellular systems, robustness can be exhibited at different levels of organization. Consideration of two widespread patterning mechanisms suggests that robustness at the level of cell communities can result from variable development at the level of individual cells; models of these mechanisms show how interactions between participating cells guarantee community-level robustness. Cooperative interactions enhance homogeneity within communities of like cells and the sharpness of boundaries between communities of distinct cells, while competitive interactions amplify small inhomogeneities within communities of initially equivalent cells, resulting in fine-grained patterns of cell specialization.

The nested assembly of individual-resource networks,"P>1. Much of the current understanding of ecological systems is based on theory that does not explicitly take into account individual variation within natural populations. However, individuals may show substantial variation in resource use. This variation in turn may be translated into topological properties of networks that depict interactions among individuals and the food resources they consume (individual-resource networks). 2. Different models derived from optimal diet theory (ODT) predict highly distinct patterns of trophic interactions at the individual level that should translate into distinct network topologies. As a consequence, individual-resource networks can be useful tools in revealing the incidence of different patterns of resource use by individuals and suggesting their mechanistic basis. 3. In the present study, using data from several dietary studies, we assembled individual-resource networks of 10 vertebrate species, previously reported to show interindividual diet variation, and used a network-based approach to investigate their structure. 4. We found significant nestedness, but no modularity, in all empirical networks, indicating that (i) these populations are composed of both opportunistic and selective individuals and (ii) the diets of the latter are ordered as predictable subsets of the diets of the more opportunistic individuals. 5. Nested patterns are a common feature of species networks, and our results extend its generality to trophic interactions at the individual level. This pattern is consistent with a recently proposed ODT model, in which individuals show similar rank preferences but differ in their acceptance rate for alternative resources. Our findings therefore suggest a common mechanism underlying interindividual variation in resource use in disparate taxa.",MA382,KJB,exclude,,,
The cost of myrmecophytism: Insights from allometry of stem secondary growth,"Background and AimsPlant defence traits against herbivores incur production costs that are usually difficult to measure. However, estimating these costs is a prerequisite for characterizing the plant defence strategy as a whole. Myrmecophytes are plants that provide symbiotic ants with specialized nesting cavities, called domatia, in exchange for protection against herbivores. In the particular case of stem domatia, production of extra wood seems to be the only associated cost, making this indirect defence trait a particularly suitable model for estimating the cost of defence. MethodsMeasurements were made of growth pattern and cumulative production cost of domatia over secondary growth in the myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana subsp. africana, whose internodes display both a solid basal segment and a hollow distal part (the domatium), thus allowing paired comparison of investment in wood. Key ResultsPrevious studies showed that 'overconstruction' of the hollow part of internodes during primary growth is needed for mechanical support. In this study, it is shown that the relationship between the woody cross-sectional area of the solid and hollow parts of internodes is negatively allometric at the beginning of secondary growth and nearly isometric later on. Thus, in hollow stems, the first phase of slow secondary growth compensates for the 'overconstruction' of the ring of wood during primary growth. Moreover, the cumulative production cost of a domatium (estimated as the additional volume of wood required for a hollow stem compared with a solid one) is very high at the beginning of secondary growth and then quickly tends to zero. ConclusionsMaking domatia incurs high costs early in ontogeny, costs that are then amortized later in development of stems and of individual plants. Characterizing ontogenetic variation of the net cost of this peculiar defence mechanism will help us build more accurate theoretical models of resource allocation in myrmecophytes.  2012 The Author.",MA366,KJB,exclude,,,
Evolution and invasion dynamics of multiple infections with Wolbachia investigated using matrix based models,"Endosymbiotic bacteria are often transmitted vertically from one host generation to the next via oocytes cytoplasm. The generally small number of colonizing bacteria in the oocytes leads to a bottleneck at each generation, resulting in genetic homogenization of the symbiotic population. Nevertheless, in many of the species infected by Wolbachia (maternally transmitted bacteria), individuals do sometimes simultaneously harbor several bacterial strains, owing to the fact that Wolbachia induces cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that maintains multiple infections. CI occurs in crosses in which the male is infected by at least one Wolbachia strain that the female lacks, and consequently it favors individuals with the greatest symbiotic diversity. CI results in death of offspring in diploid species. In haplodiploid individuals, unfertilized eggs hatch normally into mates and fertilized ones, which would lead to females, either die (female mortality type: FM) or develop into males (male development type: MD). Until now, only one theoretical study, restricted to diploid species, has investigated the associations where multiple CI-inducing Wolbachia co-exist, and explored the conditions under which multiple infections can spread. The consequences of double infections on Wolbachia maintenance in host populations, and the selective pressures to which it is subjected have not yet been analysed. Here, we have re-written a model previously developed for single infection in matrix form, which allows easy extension to multiple infections and introduction of mutant strains. We show that (i) the CI type has a strong influence on invasiveness and maintenance of multiple infections; (ii) double infection lowers the invasion threshold of less competitive strains that hitch-hike with their companion strain; (iii) when multiple infections occur, as in single infections, the strains selected are those which maximize the production of infected offspring; and (iv) for the MD CI type, invasion of mutant strains can carry the whole infection to extinction.

Host sharing by the honey bee parasites Lotmaria passim and Nosema ceranae,"The trypanosome Lotmaria passim and the microsporidian Nosema ceranae are common parasites of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, intestine, but the nature of interactions between them is unknown. Here, we took advantage of naturally occurring infections and quantified infection loads of individual workers (N=408) originating from three apiaries (four colonies per apiary) using PCR to test for interactions between these two parasites. For that purpose, we measured the frequency of single and double infections, estimated the parasite loads of single and double infections, and determined the type of correlation between both parasites in double infections. If interactions between both parasites are strong and antagonistic, single infections should be more frequent than double infections, double infections will have lower parasite loads than single infections, and double infections will present a negative correlation. Overall, a total of 88 workers were infected with N.ceranae, 53 with L.passim, and eight with both parasites. Although both parasites were found in all three apiaries, there were significant differences among apiaries in the proportions of infected bees. The data show no significant differences between the expected and observed frequencies of single- and double-infected bees. While the infection loads of individual bees were significantly higher for L.passim compared to N.ceranae, there were no significant differences in infection loads between single- and double-infected hosts for both parasites. These results suggest no strong interactions between the two parasites in honey bees, possibly due to spatial separation in the host. The significant positive correlation between L.passim and N.ceranae infection loads in double-infected hosts therefore most likely results from differences among individual hosts rather than cooperation between parasites. Even if hosts are infected by multiple parasites, this does not necessarily imply that there are any significant interactions between them.  2017 The Authors.

Myrmica ants host highly diverse parasitic communities: from social parasites to microbes,"Myrmica ants have been model species for studies in a variety of disciplines, including insect physiology, chemical communication, ant social dynamics, ant population, community ecology, and ant interactions with other organisms. Species belonging to the genus Myrmica can be found in virtually every habitat within the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and their biology and systematics have been thoroughly studied. These ants serve as hosts to highly diverse parasitic organisms from socially parasitic butterfly caterpillars to microbes, and many Myrmica species even evolved into parasitizing species of their own genus. These parasites have various impacts both on the individuals and on the social structure of their hosts, ranging from morphological malformations to reduction in colony fitness. A comprehensive review of the parasitic organisms supported by Myrmica and the effects of these organisms on individuals and on whole ant colonies has not yet been compiled. Here, we provide a review of the interactions of these organisms with Myrmica ants by discussing host and parasite functional, behavioral or physiological adaptations. In addition, for all symbiont groups of Myrmica ants described in this paper, we examine the present limitations of the knowledge at present of their impact on individuals and host colony fitness. In conclusion, we argue that Myrmica ants serve as remarkable resource for the evolution of a wide variety of associated organisms.  2014, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",MA254,KJB,exclude,,,

"Hierarchical effects of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks on cactus recruitment","AimsPlant facilitation is recognized as an important process, contributing not only to the ecology of individual species, but the diversity, organization and stability of communities as a whole. While decades of studies have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to plant facilitation, greater attention is now being given to the conditionality of the mechanisms, whereby multiple biotic and abiotic factors may act independently and jointly with one another in shaping plant-plant facilitation. Our objective was to evaluate the conditionality and hierarchy of mechanisms contributing to cactus germination and early seedling recruitment arising from plant-plant facilitation, including the effects of seed banks, rainfall, granivory and nurse plants. LocationBahia de Kina, Sonora, Mexico; Sonoran Desert of North America. MethodsWe employed descriptive analyses and a factorial experiment to examine the consequences of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks for senita cactus recruitment (Pachycereus schottii) in two plant communities of the Sonoran Desert: one degraded of its key nurse plants and the other with its nurse plants intact. ResultsSeed banks did not occur in either of the plant communities, indicating that seed banks and seed dormancy do not affect senita recruitment and thereby do not modulate other mechanisms that contribute to nurse plant facilitation and cactus recruitment. Juvenile senita cacti were consistently associated with nurse plants in both plant communities. Yet, the density and species composition of nurse plants differed between the communities, resulting in reduced senita recruitment and shifts to alternative nurse plants in the community degraded of its key nurse plants compared to the intact community. In a factorial experiment manipulating rainfall, granivory and nurse plants, we found that rainfall and granivory had significant main factor effects, leading to increases and decreases in seedling recruitment, respectively. There was no main factor effect of nurse plants, but there was a significant nurse plant by granivory interaction, indicating that nurse plants increase seedling recruitment through escape from granivory conditional upon rainfall. ConclusionsTaken together, these results reveal a conditional hierarchy of mechanisms of plant-plant facilitation shaping senita cactus recruitment, namely the predominant effects of rainfall increasing recruitment and of granivory decreasing recruitment, for which nurse plants played a key role in increasing seedling recruitment with rainfall and by reducing granivory.",MA177,KJB,exclude,,,
Interindividual patterns of resource use in three subtropical Atlantic Forest frogs,"Studies with disparate taxa suggest that generalist populations are composed of relatively specialist individuals that use a narrow part of a population's resource pool. Models based on optimum diet theory (ODT) can be used to predict different patterns of variation in resource use among individuals. In this work, we investigated the diet and measured the degree of individual specialization of three anuran species, Hypsiboas leptolineatus, Pseudis cardosoi and Scinax granulatus, from the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. The study is based on gut content obtained using a stomach-flushing technique. Additionally, we tested for a correlation between the individuals' diet and morphological variation. Furthermore, we applied methods based on network theory to investigate patterns of resource use among individuals of each species. All three study species showed generalized diets and significant values of individual specialization. However, we did not find any correlation between diet and morphology, indicating that diet variation is not a consequence of morphological trade-offs. The individual-resource networks of H.leptolineatus and S.granulatus showed a nested pattern. This result indicates the presence of individuals with more diverse diets than others, and the diets of the more specialist individuals are a predictable subset of the diets of the more generalist ones. The individual-resource network of P.cardosoi did not show a distinct pattern, diverging from what was predicted by optimal diet theory-based models. Although nested or modular patterns are commonly found in individual-resource networks, our results indicate that they are not ubiquitous and that random patterns can also be found.",MA213,KJB,exclude,,,
ARE THERE GENERAL-PRINCIPLES OF SIGNAL-DESIGN,"Explanations of signal design must meet three requirements: they must be logically coherent, they must explain the diversity in size of animal signals and they must explain the diversity in form of signals. Three selection pressures operating on animal signals are discussed: the degree of conflict or cooperation, the `efficacy' of signals and how signalling costs are paid. A distinction is made between cases where costs of signalling are paid in the production of the signal and cases where costs are paid as a consequence of giving a signal on the grounds that differences in signal design result. This is illustrated by reference to the example of warning coloration. It is concluded that general principles still elude us because of the numbers of different selection pressures that operate on the design of animal signals.",MA24,KJB,include,,signalling,"Not sure, assuming that the presence of variation is crucial for signalling to evolve and hence it may affect interactions between individuals."
Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle,"Current work on cooperation is focused on the theory of reciprocal altruism. However, reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples. Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited. I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour. Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non-altruists may become ostracized. I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity. Altruism may be rewarded in kind, but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all, for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates. This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity. I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality, as proposed by the handicap principle. I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers. I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished.",MA63,KJB,include,intraspecific,"modelling, altruism, competition",
DOES HOST-PLANT QUALITY MEDIATE APHID-ANT MUTUALISM,"We investigated the hypothesis that variation in the quality of the host plant (Epilobium angustifolium) mediated the mutualistic interaction between a phloem-feeding homopteran (Aphis varians) and the ant (Formica cinerea) tending it.  First, we used a bioassay to define the quality of Epilobium for A. varians.  We established cohorts of first-instar A. varians on fireweed shoots of different heights.  Development time, size at maturity, and the number and size of embryos per adult were significantly correlated with plant height.  Therefore, plant height provided an indirect measure of plant quality. Second, we experimentally tested the effects of plant height and tending by ants on the growth of aphid populations.  We conducted this experiment in the absence of natural enemies of A. varians in order to examine the direct link between plants, aphids and ants, rather than the indirect links involving the natural enemies of aphids.  As expected, population growth of A. varians on individual Epilobium ramets was positively correlated with plant height.  However, in the absence of natural enemies, the effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations did not vary with plant height.  The absence of an interaction between tending by ants and plant quality was probably due to two processes. First, although there were more ants tending on higher quality host plants, the absolute number of ants tending aphids was low and the increase in the number of ants with increases in plant quality was small.  Second, in the absence of natural enemies and at initial densities of approximately 100 aphids per plant, we were unable to detect a significant effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations. We conclude that host-plant mediation did not occur in this aphid-ant interaction, but we do not know whether this was the result of 1) excluding predators, 2) using initial densities above which ants no longer benefit aphids, 3) the low numbers of ants, or 4) small sample sizes.",MA101,KJB,include,interspecific,mutualistic interactions,"Seems to be 3 species and not much evidence was found in the end, but didn’t want to exclude it just yet."
"All signals are not equal: acoustic signalling of individuality, sex and breeding status in a cooperative breeder","Repeated interactions between individuals in socially living animals select for the evolution of signals that convey information identifying individuals or categories of individuals, which may enable the discrimination of familiar versus unfamiliar individuals. Such information may help animals maximize their inclusive fitness by adjusting their own behaviour, allowing them to avoid conflict, preferentially direct help and/or ignore unreliable individuals. Acoustic signals in birds provide the potential to encode individual-specific information. We examined the degree to which individual identity, sex, breeding status, group membership and genetic relatedness were related to variability in six different call types, which occurred across a variety of different behavioural contexts in the apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea, a socially living and cooperatively breeding Australian passerine. We demonstrated that not all calls reflected the same extent of information. Of the six call types, call variation was related to individual identity in three call types, breeding status in two call types and sex and group relatedness in one call type. Finally, variation in two call types was not related to any of the measured variables. Our results suggest that some, but not all, acoustic signals in apostlebirds may be selected for individual distinctiveness between individuals and categories of individuals (male versus female, breeder versus nonbreeder), and these signals may be important in determining levels of cooperation and interaction between individuals in this cooperatively breeding society.

Stable social relationships between unrelated females increase individual fitness in a cooperative bird,"Social animals often form long-lasting relationships with fellow group members, usually with close kin. In primates, strong social bonds have been associated with increased longevity, offspring survival and reproductive success. However, little is known about the fitness effects of social bonds between non-kin, especially outside of mammals. In this study, we use long-term field research on a cooperatively breeding bird, the greater ani (Crotophaga major), to ask whether adult females benefit by remaining in long-term associations with unrelated, co-breeding females. We find that females that have previously nested together synchronize their reproduction more rapidly than those nesting with unfamiliar partners, which leads to lower competition and higher fledging success. Importantly, although previous experience with a co-breeding female influenced reproductive synchrony, the degree of reproductive synchrony did not influence whether co-breeding females remained together in subsequent years, ruling out the alternate hypothesis that highly synchronized females are simply more likely to remain together. These results indicate that switching groups is costly to females, and that social familiarity improves reproductive coordination. Stable social relationships therefore have significant fitness consequences for cooperatively nesting female birds, suggesting that direct benefits alone may favour the evolution of associations between non-relatives and contribute to long-term group stability.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Isolation of naturally associated bacteria of necromenic Pristionchus nematodes and fitness consequences,"Nematodes and bacteria are major components of the soil ecosystem. Many nematodes use bacteria for food, whereas others evolved specialized bacterial interactions ranging from mutualism to parasitism. Little is known about the biological mechanisms by which nematode - bacterial interactions are achieved, largely because in the laboratory nematodes are often cultured under artificial conditions. We investigated the bacterial interactions of nematodes from the genus Pristionchus that have a strong association with scarab beetles. Pristionchus has a different feeding strategy than Caenorhabditis and meta-genomic 16S sequence analysis of Pristionchus individuals showed a diversity of living bacteria within the nematode gut and on the nematode cuticle. Twenty-three different bacterial strains were isolated from three Pristionchus - beetle associations and were used to study nematode - bacterial interactions under controlled laboratory conditions. We show a continuum of bacterial interactions from dissemination, to reduction in brood size and nematode mortality caused by bacteria derived from insect hosts. Olfactory discrimination experiments show distinct chemoattraction and fitness profiles of Pristionchus nematodes when exposed to different bacteria. For example, Pristionchus pacificus avoids Serratia marcescens possibly because of pathogenicity. Also, P. pacificus avoids Bacillus thuringiensis and insect pathogenic bacteria but is resistant to the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, unlike Caenorhabditis elegans. Pristionchus specifically recognize and respond to bacteria that cause ill health. Bringing the nematode - bacterial interaction into the laboratory allows detailed functional studies, including the genetic manipulation of the interaction in both nematodes and bacteria.",MA226,KJB,exclude,,,
Age-dependent change of coalitionary strategy in male Barbary macaques,"Inter-and intra-specific variation in the propensity to form coalitions has been explained by variation in the availability of suitable partners, distribution of fighting ability, coalition profitability, and costs of coordination. Male coalition formation can be an alternative reproductive strategy to one-on-one competition to maximize male reproductive success. Here we focus on age as a state variable to explain within-group variation in individual propensity to form coalitions against other group members. We specifically test the prediction that males conditionally switch from a solo strategy for achievement of high mating success to a cooperative strategy after reaching post-prime age in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We combined new observations with data collected in 2006 and 2008 on the same individuals from one captive group living in semi-natural conditions at Affenberg Salem, Germany, and found that in all years males between 5 and 13 years formed significantly fewer coalitions than males 14 years and older (post-prime). More importantly, we found those males that aged into the post-prime phase to have switched their reproductive strategy and to form significantly more coalitions in 2014 compared to 2008. These first longitudinal data together with earlier cross-sectional analyses in this and other primate species suggest that group-level measures of coalition propensity may be strongly affected by the age composition of groups and that male coalition formation can be a conditional reproductive strategy.

Antagonistic interactions between honey bee bacterial symbionts and implications for disease,"Background: Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. One route by which honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae. Results: Here we isolate, culture, and describe by 16S rRNA and protein-coding gene sequences 61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly, symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this widespread pathogen. Conclusion: The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an important bee disease.  2006 Evans and Armstrong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA20,KJB,exclude,,,
