MA182,Host species and environmental variation can influence rhizobial community composition,"Nitrogen-fixing rhizobial mutualists display high levels of genetic and phenotypic diversity at multiple spatial scales. Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of variation in the genetic composition and function of rhizobial communities is critical to understanding rhizobial impacts on community and ecosystem productivity. In this study, we examined how environmental factors and host species jointly affect rhizobial phenotypic diversity and community structure. Individual host plants of two native Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and A.stenophylla, were inoculated with a community of six rhizobial strains (belonging to three genera) previously characterized for symbiotic effectiveness. The plants were grown in a fully factorial experiment under high and low phosphorus and water, and high or no nitrogen. Half the plants were harvested after 19weeks and the other half after 30weeks. The relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was characterized using amplicon sequencing of the rhizobial 16S rRNA gene from DNA extracted from the root nodules of plants after each harvest. Variation in the relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was best explained by host species, although interactions between environment and host species also emerged as significant predictors of variation in rhizobial community composition. We detected strong host-specific interactions for two strains, while two other strains were clearly generalists, being relatively abundant in both host species. For both host species, the two generalist strains were as abundant as the best specialist strain within the rhizobial community. Synthesis. Our study show host species identity as the key determinant of rhizobial community structure within the root nodules of Acacia plants. Strains that were efficient at promoting the growth of their host plant had high relative abundance in experimental communities. Furthermore, interaction among host species, rhizobial host-range, and environmental variation determine the structure of rhizobial communities, although not in clearly predictable ways. Such interactions contributed to the maintenance (albeit at relatively low frequencies) of ineffective strains in nodule communities. These interacting effects could help to explain why rhizobial communities are functionally diverse, such that specialists, generalists and seemingly ineffective rhizobia, can be simultaneously maintained in rhizosphere communities.  2016 The Authors.

MA304,Repeatability of feather mite prevalence and intensity in passerine birds,"Understanding why host species differ so much in symbiont loads and how this depends on ecological host and symbiont traits is a major issue in the ecology of symbiosis. A first step in this inquiry is to know whether observed differences among host species are species-specific traits or more related with host-symbiont environmental conditions. Here we analysed the repeatability (R) of the intensity and the prevalence of feather mites to partition within- and among-host species variance components. We compiled the largest dataset so far available: 119 Paleartic passerine bird species, 75,944 individual birds, ca. 1.8 million mites, seven countries, 23 study years. Several analyses and approaches were made to estimate R and adjusted repeatability (Radj) after controlling for potential confounding factors (breeding period, weather, habitat, spatial autocorrelation and researcher identity). The prevalence of feather mites was moderately repeatable (R = 0.26-0.53; Radj = 0.32-0.57); smaller values were found for intensity (R = 0.19-0.30; Radj = 0.18-0.30). These moderate repeatabilities show that prevalence and intensity of feather mites differ among species, but also that the high variation within species leads to considerable overlap among bird species. Differences in the prevalence and intensity of feather mites within bird species were small among habitats, suggesting that local factors are playing a secondary role. However, effects of local climatic conditions were partially observed for intensity.  2014 Diaz-Real et al.

MA260,Nuclear and genome dynamics in multinucleate ascomycete fungi,"Genetic variation between individuals is essential to evolution and adaptation. However, intra-organismic genetic variation also shapes the life histories of many organisms, including filamentous fungi. A single fungal syncytium can harbor thousands or millions of mobile and potentially genotypically different nuclei, each having the capacity to regenerate a new organism. Because the dispersal of asexual or sexual spores propagates individual nuclei in many of these species, selection acting at the level of nuclei creates the potential for competitive and cooperative genome dynamics. Recent work in Neurospora crassa and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has illuminated how nuclear populations are coordinated for fungal growth and other behaviors and has revealed both molecular and physical mechanisms for preventing and policing inter-genomic conflict. Recent results from population-level genomic studies in a variety of filamentous fungi suggest that nuclear exchange between mycelia and recombination between heterospecific nuclei may be of more importance to fungal evolution, diversity and the emergence of newly virulent strains than has previously been recognized.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

MA187,Hotspots of damage by antagonists shape the spatial structure of plant-pollinator interactions,"The balance between mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions and their spatial variation results in a highly dynamic mosaic of reproductive success within plant populations. Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",MW,"exclude (no clear intraspecific trait variation, but rather different species)",,
MA194,"Inclusive fitness, asymmetric competition and kin selection in plants","The findings that some plants alter their competitive phenotype in response to genetic relatedness of its conspecific neighbour (and presumed competitor) has spurred an increasing interest in plant kin-interactions. This phenotypic response suggests the ability to assess the genetic relatedness of conspecific competitors, proposing kin selection as a process that can influence plant competitive interactions. Kin selection can favour restrained competitive growth towards kin, if the fitness loss from reducing own growth is compensated by increased fitness in the related neighbour. This may lead to positive frequency dependency among related conspecifics with important ecological consequences for species assemblage and coexistence. However, kin selection in plants is still controversial. First, many studies documenting a plastic response to neighbour relatedness do not estimate fitness consequences of the individual that responds, and when estimated, fitness of individuals grown in competition with kin did not necessarily exceed that of individuals grown in non-kin groups. Although higher fitness in kin groups could be consistent with kin selection, this could also arise from mechanisms like asymmetric competition in the non-kin groups. Here we outline the main challenges for studying kin selection in plants taking genetic variation for competitive ability into account. We emphasize the need to measure inclusive fitness in order to assess whether kin selection occurs, and show under which circumstances kin selected responses can be expected. We also illustrate why direct fitness estimates of a focal plant, and group fitness estimates are not suitable for documenting kin selection. Importantly, natural selection occurs at the individual level and it is the inclusive fitness of an individual plant - not the mean fitness of the group - that can capture if a differential response to neighbour relatedness is favoured by kin selection.",MW,exclude (no clear trait),,
MA355,Studies of the social ecology of Norwegian killer whales (Orcinus orca),"Killer whales along the Norwegian coast have been studied since 1990 with methods based on photo-identification. Preliminary insights of the social characteristics of Norwegian killer whales are presented generally. About 400 killer whales are identified, and 65% of the whales have been resighted. The whales occur in groups of moderate sizes, all containing adult males and breeding females. The groups seem to be social units based at least partly on stable membership. Acoustic analyses revealed both uniqueness and a variable degree of similarity in the vocalization of different groups of whales. The social integrity of groups is further indicated by cooperative feeding on herring, communal care of young, competitive interactions between groups and specialized feeding on marine mammals by one small group of whales. Some adult males have a nomadic occurrence, and, might eventually represent a mating strategy. Ritualized interactions between males appear to be affiliation acts. Large males and female-sized whales do not seem to differentiate in diving behaviour during cooperative feeding due to synchrony in respiration patterns. Norwegian killer whales eresemble the well-studied Canadian killer whales, but there are also indications of some intraspecific variability.  1995, Elsevier B.V.

MA99,Do seed-dispersing birds exert selection on optimal plant trait combinations? Correlated phenotypic selection on the fruit and seed size of hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna),"Seed-dispersing birds can be expected to optimize their energy intake through fruit selection and hence exert a positive selection on fruit pulp content, that is to say, favoring big fruits with small seeds. On the other hand they may select both, average fruit size and its variation. We addressed this issue by analyzing the phenotypic selection exerted by the dispersers of Crataegus monogyna on the fruit and seed size of this species. Fruit and seed size were analyzed at two ontogenic plant stages: the initial size of seeds (and their fruits) as future individuals and the mean size of fruits and seeds produced by adult plants. Fruit diameter and its within-individual variation are the actual targets of selection for maternal fruit traits, negatively affecting relative fitness, although total selection acts only on mean fruit size. For individual seeds, size selection is positive and directed at fruit diameter and seed length, while the remaining traits are subject to indirect selection. Birds exerted a correlational selection favoring big fruits with small seeds. Nevertheless the evolutionary consequences of this selection are expected to be limited by several factors. For example, the positive correlation between fruit and seed sizes, the existence of counteracting selective pressures exerted by other mutualistic or antagonist interactions and temporal or spatial changes in the environmental conditions that may alter the selective forces and even the optimum phenotype in each situation.",MW,include,interspecific,Plant-seed-disperser
MA97,Diversity within diversity: Parasite species richness in poison frogs assessed by transcriptomics,"Symbionts (e.g., endoparasites and commensals) play an integral role in their host's ecology, yet in many cases their diversity is likely underestimated. Although endoparasites are traditionally characterized using morphology, sequences of conserved genes, and shotgun metagenomics, host transcriptomes constitute an underused resource to identify these organisms' diversity. By isolating non-host transcripts from host transcriptomes, individual host tissues can now simultaneously reveal their endoparasite species richness (i.e., number of different taxa) and provide insights into parasite gene expression. These approaches can be used in host taxa whose endoparasites are mostly unknown, such as those of tropical amphibians. Here, we focus on the poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) as hosts, which are a Neotropical clade known for their bright coloration and defensive alkaloids. These toxins are an effective protection against vertebrate predators (e.g., snakes and birds), bacteria, and skin-biting ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes); however, little is known about their deterrence against eukaryotic endoparasites. With de novo transcriptomes of dendrobatids, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline for endoparasite identification that uses host annotated RNA-seq data and set of a priori parasite taxonomic terms, which are used to mine for specific endoparasites. We found a large community of helminths and protozoans that were mostly restricted to the digestive tract and a few systemic parasites (e.g., Trypanosoma). Contrary to our expectations, all dendrobatid frogs regardless of the presence of alkaloid defenses have endoparasites, with their highest species richness located in the frog digestive tract. Some of these organisms (e.g., roundworms) might prove to be generalists, as they were not found to be co-diversifying with their frog hosts. We propose that endoparasites may escape poison frogs' chemical defenses by colonizing tissues with fewer alkaloids than the frog's skin, where most toxins are stored.",MW,"exclude (not clear if there is intraspecific trait variation, no shift)",,
MA354,Strategic adjustment of begging effort by banded mongoose pups,"Variation in the intensity of conspicuous displays raises three basic questions: (i) the relationship between internal state and display intensity, (ii) the relationship between display intensity and receiver response, and (iii) the effect of variation in receiver responsiveness on signaller behaviour. Here, I investigate the interaction between pups and helpers in the communally breeding banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), where each pup forms an exclusive relationship with a single adult helper (termed its 'escort'). By experimentally manipulating pup need, I demonstrate that changes in begging rate correspond to changes in short-term need. The data then suggest that escorts in good condition may be more responsive to increased begging and that pups associating with them increase their begging more than do pups paired with escorts in poor condition. Escorts also appear more responsive to increased begging by female pups, and female pups increase their begging more than do male pups. These results suggest that banded mongoose pups may strategically adjust their investment in begging in relation to variation in the expected pay-off. I argue that such adjustment is likely to be a general phenomenon: wherever there is variation in responsiveness to signals, signallers will be selected to identify different categories of receiver and adjust their signals in order to maximize the pay-offs. Therefore, differences in signal intensity may be as much a product of context as an indication of variation in individual phenotypic or genotypic state.  2008 The Royal Society.",MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
MA306,Reproductive skew and the evolution of group dissolution tactics: a synthesis of concession and restraint models,"Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for the partitioning of reproduction among individuals within animal societies. One constructive criticism of the theory is that there are too many models, all of which have different assumptions and predictions, which makes it difficult to know what to test. Here we begin the process of tackling this problem, by re-examining the assumptions and predictions of basic concession and restraint models, two transactional models that are often tested as alternatives. Concession models assume that the dominant has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may yield some of the group's reproduction to prevent the subordinate from voluntarily departing. Restraint models assume that the subordinate has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may not claim all of the group's reproduction to prevent the dominant from forcibly evicting it. We show that the group dissolution tactics that individuals use ( forcible eviction or voluntary departure) need not be an assumption of the model, but rather they can be predicted using Hamilton's rule and the standard variables of skew models. We reveal that the assumption that one individual ( dominant or subordinate) has complete control over the allocation of reproduction is an idea common to both models, and we resolve this semantic difference by calling this individual `the allocator'. We show that, regardless of the group dissolution tactics that individuals adopt, the allocator's share of the reproduction always increases as relatedness increases, as group productivity increases, and as constraints on leaving to breed elsewhere intensify. We conclude that concession and restraint type models make qualitatively similar predictions, and should not be tested as alternatives. In summary, this study makes the transactional framework of reproductive skew more general, by eliminating restrictive assumptions, and more amenable to testing in the field, by clarifying assumptions and predictions.

MA303,Regional collapse of symbiotic specificity between lucanid beetles and canestriniid mites,"The intensity of interspecific interactions between hosts and symbionts varies among populations of each organism because of differences in the biotic and abiotic environment. We found geographic mosaics in associations between lucanid beetles (Dorcus rectus and Dorcus striatipennis) and symbiotic mites (Haitlingeria sp. and Sandrophela sp., respectively) that were caused by the collapse of host specificity in the northern part of Japan. Haitlingeria sp. was only collected from the surface of the exoskeleton ofD. rectus in south and central Japan. Sandrophela sp. showed host specificity in southern to central Japan but was found on both beetle species in areas where Haitlingeria sp. was not found. Because Haitlingeria sp. was able to reproduce on D. rectus collected from Haitlingeria-free regions and no significant differences were observed in average temperature between the hostspecific and nonspecific regions bordering on each other, we suggest that the expansion of Haitlingeria sp. in the north has been limited for unknown reasons. When both mites were placed together on D. rectus, only Haitlingeria sp. reproduced, probably because it killed Sandrophela sp., especially juveniles. Thus, we conclude that Sandrophela sp. has expanded its host use to include D. rectus in areas where Haitlingeria sp. is absent. We hypothesise that false host specificity in the canestriniids has been maintained by habitat isolation and/or aggressive behaviour toward competitors.We suggest that host-specific canestriniids provide benefits to hosts that do not develop countermeasures to exclude microor macroparasites from their surfaces.

MA24,ARE THERE GENERAL-PRINCIPLES OF SIGNAL-DESIGN,"Explanations of signal design must meet three requirements: they must be logically coherent, they must explain the diversity in size of animal signals and they must explain the diversity in form of signals. Three selection pressures operating on animal signals are discussed: the degree of conflict or cooperation, the `efficacy' of signals and how signalling costs are paid. A distinction is made between cases where costs of signalling are paid in the production of the signal and cases where costs are paid as a consequence of giving a signal on the grounds that differences in signal design result. This is illustrated by reference to the example of warning coloration. It is concluded that general principles still elude us because of the numbers of different selection pressures that operate on the design of animal signals.",MW,"exclude (more about the evolution of the signals, not about shifts in interaction)",,
MA171,Group size effects in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs,"In groups of cooperative breeders, individual fitness can increase as a direct consequence of group size, whereby the extent of these benefits is likely to depend, to a degree that is largely unknown, on the prevailing ecological conditions. We examined the effect of group size on pup production and survival across age classes in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, across 12 quasiexperimental sites in South Africa varying in ecological conditions. In this sample spanning over 43 pack-years, group size had a significantly positive effect on litter size after emergence from the den, but not on number of pups surviving to 1 year of age or survival rates for pups, yearlings and adults. Stronger relationships between these variables have been reported in other samples, so these results might be explained by low competitor density and high prey availability in our study areas. This explanation is supported by the finding that neither of these variables had any significant effect on pup production and survival across age classes in the present study. The results of our quasiexperimental study suggest that varying ecological conditions represent an important source of intraspecific variation in the impact of helpers in cooperative breeders.

MA178,High diversity and low genetic structure of feather mites associated with a phenotypically variable bird host,"Obligate symbionts may be genetically structured among host individuals and among phenotypically distinct host populations. Such processes may in turn determine within-host genetic diversity of symbionts, which is relevant for understanding symbiont population dynamics. We analysed the population genetic structure of two species of feather mites (Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata) in migratory and resident blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla that winter sympatrically. Resident and migratory hosts may provide mites with habitats of different qualities, what might promote specialization of mite populations. We found high genetic diversity of within-host populations for both mite species, but no sign of genetic structure of mites between migratory and resident hosts. Our results suggest that, although dispersal mechanisms between hosts during the non-breeding season are unclear, mite populations are not limited by transmission bottlenecks that would reduce genetic diversity among individuals that share a host. Additionally, there is no evidence that host phenotypic divergence (associated with the evolution of migration and residency) has promoted the evolution of host-specialist mite populations. Unrestricted dispersal among host types may allow symbiotic organisms to avoid inbreeding and to persist in the face of habitat heterogeneity in phenotypically diverse host populations.

MA320,"Sexual conflict, ecology, and breeding systems in shorebirds","Evolutionary biologists strive to understand the immense variation in animals' breeding systems. Shorebirds represent an ideal model system for this endeavor, because they exhibit diverse breeding systems that include monogamy, with the parents cooperating to rear the young; and polygamy by the male, the female, or both parents, with one parent taking full responsibility for incubating the eggs and rearing the young. Recent experimental manipulations, mathematical models, and phylogenetic analyses reveal that evolutionary pressures may diverge as they act on mated pairs of shorebirds, favoring one parent at a cost to the other. We argue that different reproductive payoffs for the male and the female have had fundamental implications for the evolution of diverse breeding systems.  2006 American Institute of Biological Sciences.",MW,include,intraspecific,Male-female
MA157,From pattern to process: Species and functional diversity in fungal endophytes of Abies beshanzuensis,"The biodiversity-functional relationship in fungal ecology was recently developed and debated, but has rarely been addressed in endophytes. In this study, an integrative culture system was designed to capture a rich fungal consortium from the conifer Abies beshanzuensis. Results indicate an impressive diversity of fungal lineages (a total of 84 taxa classified in Dikarya) and a relatively high proportion of hitherto unknown species (27.4. %). The laccase gene was used as a functional marker due to its involvement in lignocellulose degradation. Remarkable diversity of laccase genes was found across a wide range of taxa, with at least 35 and 19 distinct sequences in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes respectively, were revealed. Many groups displayed variable ability to decompose needles. Furthermore, many ascomycetes, including three volatile-producing Muscodor species (Xylariaceae), showed the ability to inhibit pathogens. Notably, most laccase-producing species showed little or no antibiosis and vice versa. Clavicipitalean and ustilaginomycetous fungi, specifically toxic to insects, were inferred from taxonomic information. Intra-specific physiological variation in Pezicula sporulosa, a second dominant species, was clearly high. We conclude that a suite of defensive characteristics in endophytes contributes to improving host fitness under various stresses and that a diversity of laccase genes confers an ecological advantage in competition for nutrients. Intra-specific diversity may be of great ecological significance for ecotypic adaptation. These findings suggest a fair degree of functional complementarity rather than redundancy among endemic symbionts of natural plant populations.  2010 The British Mycological Society.",MW,include,interspecific,Host-symbiont
MA315,"Sex differences in intrasexual aggression among sex-role-reversed, cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Julidochromis regani","In sex-role-reversed species, females compete for resources (e.g., mates) more intensively than do males. However, it remains unclear whether these species exhibit sex differences in the intensity of aggressive behavior in the context of within-sex contests. Cichlid fish in the genus Julidochromis exhibit intraspecific variation in mating systems, ranging from monogamy to cooperative polyandry with sex-role reversal. In the study reported here, we observed aggressive interactions among three same-sex individuals in Julidochromis regani in the laboratory and tested whether inter-female aggression was more intense than inter-male aggression. Although difference in body size strongly determined the direction of aggression in fish, aggression by a smaller-sized individuals toward larger ones was occasionally observed. This type of aggression was common between individuals of a similar body size (<= 5 mm) and occurred more frequently among females than males. In contrast, differences in body size and sex did not affect the frequency of aggression by larger-sized individuals against smaller ones. Bidirectional aggression (i.e., mouth fighting) occurred frequently when two individuals had similar body size, and there was no difference in its frequency between sexes. However, temporal analysis showed that females performed bidirectional aggression more persistently than males. These sex differences in the intensity of intrasexual aggression could be the behavioral mechanisms underpinning cooperative polyandry.",MW,include,intraspecific,Female-female & male-male
