The behavioral sciences and sociobiology: A darwinian approach,"Darwinian natural selection theory is the theory of choice for the overwhelming majority of behavioral biologists interested in the evolution of adaptive social behavior despite many challenges to the discipline of sociobiology over the years. The initial criticisms came from a group of ideologues who argued that sociobiology was based on a form of genetic determinism. This view was dismissed by working sociobiologists for several reasons but primarily because the criticism fundamentally misrepresents the goal of the discipline, which is to test hypotheses about the evolution and adaptive value of social traits and not to examine the proximate causes that influence the development of an individual's social behavior during its lifetime. Among the additional opposing views to the discipline that have been presented over the years are those held by academics who believe (1) that evolution occurs because of differences among groups (not individuals), (2) that kin selection theory (an amendment to Darwinian natural selection theory) has failed and should be dropped, and (3) that Darwinian sexual selection (a subset of natural selection theory) should be replaced by a more modern and inclusive theory of the evolutionary effects of the interactions between the sexes. This chapter debunks each of these competitors. Darwinian theory as modified over the last 50 years continues to be the basis for evolutionary research into the interactions between the sexes, helpful behavior in its various forms, especially the evolution of altruistic behavior, and all aspects of human sociality.

Evolution of culture-dependent discriminate sociality: A gene-culture coevolutionary model,"Animals behave cooperatively towards certain conspecifics while being indifferent or even hostile to others. The distinction is made primarily according to kinship as predicted by the kin selection theory. With regards to humans, however, this is not always the case; in particular, humans sometimes exhibit a discriminate sociality on the basis of culturally transmitted traits, such as personal ornaments, languages, rituals, etc. This paper explores the possibility that the human faculty of cultural transmission and resultant cultural variation among individuals may have facilitated the evolution of discriminate sociality in humans. To this end, a gene-culture coevolutionary model is developed focusing on competition over control of resource as a context in which discriminate sociality may have evolved. Specifically, two types of culture-dependent discriminate sociality are considered: ingroup favouritism, with ingroup and outgroup being distinguished by the presence or absence of a cultural trait; and prestige hierarchies, with the prestige being conferred on the bearer of a cultural trait. The model specifies the conditions under which emergence and evolutionary stability of the two types of discriminate sociality are promoted by the presence of cultural variation among individuals.  2011 The Royal Society.",MA124,MW,include,intraspecific,"cooperation/hostility, modeling"
Conservation of protists: Is it needed at all?,"Protists have scarcely been considered in traditional perspectives and strategies in environmental management and biodiversity conservation. This is a remarkable omission given that these tiny organisms are highly diverse, and have performed as key ecological players in evolutionary theatres for over a billion years of Earth history. Protists hold key roles in nearly all ecosystems, notably as participants in fluxes of energy and matter through foodwebs that centre on their predation on microbes. In spite of this, they have been largely ignored in conservation issues due to a widespread, naive belief that protists are ubiquitous and cosmopolitanously distributed. Nevertheless, recent research shows that many protists have markedly restricted distributions. These range from palaeoendemics (Gondwanan-Laurasian distribution) to local endemics. Our ignorance about the ultimate and proximate causes of such acute disparities in scale-dependent distributions of protists can be flagged as a singular reason to preserve these more cryptic participants in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. This argument is disturbing when one considers anthropogenic modifications of landscapes and the very poorly understood roles of protists in ecological processes in soils, not least in agroecolandscapes and hydrological systems. Major concerns include host specific symbiotic, symphoric and parasitic species which become extinct, unseen and largely unknown, alongside their metazoan hosts; change or loss of habitats; massive change or loss of type localities; and losses of unique genetic resources and evolutionary potential. These concerns are illustrated by examples to argue that conservation of protists should be integral to any strategy that traditionally targets vascular plants and animals. The ongoing decline in research capacity to inventory and classify protist diversity exemplifies a most acute symptom of the failures, at local, national and international levels, to support scientific responses to the biodiversity crisis. Responsible responses to these severe problems need to centre on the revival of natural history as the core discipline in biology.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",MA72,MW,exclude,,
Male reproductive success in plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae): A microsatellite analysis,"In many social species, competition and cooperation between group members may lead to a large variance in reproductive success among individuals, especially for adult male. From April to August 2002, we studied the adult male reproductive success of plateau pikas in Haibei Alpine Meadow Ecosystem Research Station, Chinese Academy of Science, using microsatellite analysis of paternity, mark-recapture and behavioral observations. Our result indicated that the reproductive success of adult males had a large variance. Its average was 6 individuals and range was from 0 to 13 individuals. One-third of males sired 63.22\% offspring. There was a hierarchy system in polygynandrous families. Although the reproductive success of dominant males was higher than that of subordinate males, subordinate males still play an important role in the reproductive Success of the population.

Individual variation and the resolution of conflict over parental care in penduline tits,"Eurasian penduline tits (Remiz pendulinus) have an unusually diverse breeding system consisting of frequent male and female polygamy, and uniparental care by the male or the female. Intriguingly, 30 to 40 per cent of all nests are deserted by both parents. To understand the evolution of this diverse breeding system and frequent clutch desertion, we use 6 years of field data to derive fitness expectations for males and females depending on whether or not they care for their offspring. The resulting payoff matrix corresponds to an asymmetric Snowdrift Game with two alternative evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs): female-only and male-only care. This, however, does not explain the polymorphism in care strategies and frequent biparental desertion, because theory predicts that one of the two ESSs should have spread to fixation. Using a bootstrapping approach, we demonstrate that taking account of individual variation in payoffs explains the patterns of care better than a model based on the average population payoff matrix. In particular, a model incorporating differences in male attractiveness closely predicts the observed frequencies of male and female desertion. Our work highlights the need for a new generation of individual-based evolutionary game-theoretic models.  2011 The Royal Society.",MA200,MW,include,intraspecific,Male-female
Plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran desert: Current knowledge and future research perspectives,"Premise of research. Biotic interactions have long been considered to be of less importance in structuring desert systems than other ecosystem types, but biotic interactions often play a critical role in meeting the challenges posed by the extreme conditions of desert environments. The Sonoran Desert, in particular, is home to several textbook examples of mutualisms, such as the interactions between the iconic saguaro cactus and its bat pollinators. But what do we know about the diversity, ecology, and evolution of plant-animal, plant-plant, and plant-microbe interactions and their impacts on individual plants and plant species in the Sonoran Desert? Methodology. To address this question, we review the published research on seven common kinds of plant biotic interactions by revisiting the respective literature, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and outlining future research directions. Pivotal results. Numerous gaps in our knowledge of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert were identified. Studies of insect herbivory, bee pollination, and plant-microbe interactions are poorly represented in the Sonoran Desert literature. Across all categories of interaction, few have examined the impacts of interactions on plant fitness or context-dependent variation in the outcomes and strengths of interactions. For the most part, interactions have been studied at single locations and over short periods of time, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their diversity, ecology, and evolution. Conclusions. Plant biotic interactions shape the habitats in which they occur and play an important role in the maintenance of species diversity. Therefore, we call for increased efforts to fill the gaps in our understanding of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert, with an emphasis on studies linking interactions to plant fitness and the context-dependent nature of interactions. Without this knowledge we have limited capacity to predict the outcomes of global change on species interactions and to develop measures to conserve the biodiversity of the Sonoran Desert region.  2016 by The University of Chicago.

Personality and density affect nest defence and nest survival in the great tit,"Recent studies suggest that individual variation in behaviour of prey individuals may cause distinctive responses to nest predators and cooperation with conspecifics. We assessed individual differences during a novel object test and whether these responses were related to nest failure and survival of females during incubation. We additionally carried out experimental trials in natural field conditions using a stuffed pine marten, a principal nest predator, to test for a relationship between neophobia and mobbing predators. Our results show that antipredator responses of breeding great tits are dependent on their personality and personality type of neighbouring conspecifics. We found that neophilic individuals (those that rapidly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) have an advantage over neophobic individuals (those that slowly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) in their reproductive success, as measured in numbers of successful nests and of females that survived. Furthermore, neophilic-neophilic pairs exhibited stronger antipredator mobbing responses than neophobic-neophobic pairs. Results show that consistent individual differences in response against novel objects and antipredator behaviour are related, and that these responses are important predictors of nest failure in breeding great tits.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.",MA275,MW,exclude,,
The social network structure of a wild meerkat population: 3. Position of individuals within networks,"Individuals in social groups interact with numerous other group members in a polyadic network. Interactions can depend on the individual's own attributes (age, sex, status etc.), on their partner's attributes, and the group's network of social interactions. Previous studies tend to look at a subset of dyadic interactions, focusing on particular classes of individuals. We used social network analysis to explore how an individual wild meerkat's (Suricata suricatta) attributes related to their positions in three different interaction networks (grooming, dominance interactions, and foraging competitions) across eight groups. We asked whether individuals within groups associated assortatively and whether individuals with similar attributes occupied similar network positions. Differences in an individual's attributes did not consistently influence association patterns across different interaction network types. However, within network types, some attributes were especially influential across all groups. Grooming networks revealed negative assortativity by age and mass. Dominance networks revealed dominant subordinate associations and high assortativity between males. Dominant individuals exhibited higher levels of dominance interactions and were aggressive to more different individuals than subordinates. Heavier individuals received higher levels of dominance interactions. Foraging competition networks revealed that younger and lighter individuals received higher overall levels of competitions and from more group members. Our observations were similar to focused studies on dyadic interactions but also revealed subtle differences. Future descriptions of social interactions should account for networks of social interactions occurring within a group and should be cautious about treating individuals with similar attributes as functionally similar with respect to their position within a social network.",MA387,MW,include,intraspecific,various interactions
Host sharing by the honey bee parasites Lotmaria passim and Nosema ceranae,"The trypanosome Lotmaria passim and the microsporidian Nosema ceranae are common parasites of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, intestine, but the nature of interactions between them is unknown. Here, we took advantage of naturally occurring infections and quantified infection loads of individual workers (N=408) originating from three apiaries (four colonies per apiary) using PCR to test for interactions between these two parasites. For that purpose, we measured the frequency of single and double infections, estimated the parasite loads of single and double infections, and determined the type of correlation between both parasites in double infections. If interactions between both parasites are strong and antagonistic, single infections should be more frequent than double infections, double infections will have lower parasite loads than single infections, and double infections will present a negative correlation. Overall, a total of 88 workers were infected with N.ceranae, 53 with L.passim, and eight with both parasites. Although both parasites were found in all three apiaries, there were significant differences among apiaries in the proportions of infected bees. The data show no significant differences between the expected and observed frequencies of single- and double-infected bees. While the infection loads of individual bees were significantly higher for L.passim compared to N.ceranae, there were no significant differences in infection loads between single- and double-infected hosts for both parasites. These results suggest no strong interactions between the two parasites in honey bees, possibly due to spatial separation in the host. The significant positive correlation between L.passim and N.ceranae infection loads in double-infected hosts therefore most likely results from differences among individual hosts rather than cooperation between parasites. Even if hosts are infected by multiple parasites, this does not necessarily imply that there are any significant interactions between them.  2017 The Authors.

The nested assembly of individual-resource networks,"P>1. Much of the current understanding of ecological systems is based on theory that does not explicitly take into account individual variation within natural populations. However, individuals may show substantial variation in resource use. This variation in turn may be translated into topological properties of networks that depict interactions among individuals and the food resources they consume (individual-resource networks). 2. Different models derived from optimal diet theory (ODT) predict highly distinct patterns of trophic interactions at the individual level that should translate into distinct network topologies. As a consequence, individual-resource networks can be useful tools in revealing the incidence of different patterns of resource use by individuals and suggesting their mechanistic basis. 3. In the present study, using data from several dietary studies, we assembled individual-resource networks of 10 vertebrate species, previously reported to show interindividual diet variation, and used a network-based approach to investigate their structure. 4. We found significant nestedness, but no modularity, in all empirical networks, indicating that (i) these populations are composed of both opportunistic and selective individuals and (ii) the diets of the latter are ordered as predictable subsets of the diets of the more opportunistic individuals. 5. Nested patterns are a common feature of species networks, and our results extend its generality to trophic interactions at the individual level. This pattern is consistent with a recently proposed ODT model, in which individuals show similar rank preferences but differ in their acceptance rate for alternative resources. Our findings therefore suggest a common mechanism underlying interindividual variation in resource use in disparate taxa.",MA382,MW,exclude,,
Large-scale regional variation in cooperation and conflict among queens of the desert ant Messor pergandei,"To determine the extent and geographical distribution of alternative social systems in the desert ant Messor pergandei, we conducted a large-scale study within the species' range in the United States. We found that that queen social behaviours are extraordinarily diverse, resulting in three distinct colony social systems distributed in different geographical regions. Experiments show that these differences arise from variation in queen behaviours at two distinct times in the colony life cycle, and are likely to result from underlying genetic differences between regions. Results from our population genetics analyses and the biogeography of the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts suggest that the different queen social behaviours may have evolved in previously isolated populations, with their current distributions explained in part by subsequent range expansions rather than local adaptation in situ. However, regions with alternative social forms currently meet in contact zones where gene flow and natural selection on alternative social systems should occur. The degree of geographical variation in social behaviours exhibited by M. pergandei results in an opportunity to study the role that gene flow, local adaptation, genetic drift and past history can play in the evolution of behaviour.  2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",MA228,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
Evolutionary conserved neural signature of early life stress affects animal social competence,"In vertebrates, the earlysocial environment can persistently influence behaviour and social competence later in life. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in animal social competence are largely unknown. In rats, high-quality maternal care causes an upregulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (gr) and reduces offspring stress responsiveness. This identifies gr regulation as a candidate mechanism for maintaining variation in animal social competence. We tested this hypothesis in a highly social cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher, reared with or without caring parents. We find that the molecular pathway translating early social experience into later-life alterations of the stress axis is homologous across vertebrates: fish reared with parents expressed the glucocorticoid receptor gr1 more in the telencephalon. Furthermore, expression levels of the transcription factor egr-1 (early growth response 1) were associated with gr1 expression in the telencephalon and hypothalamus. When blocking glucocorticoid receptors (GR) with an antagonist, mifepristone (RU486), parent-reared individuals showed more socially appropriate, submissive behaviour when intruding on a larger conspecifics territory. Remarkably, mifepristone-treated fish were less attacked by territory owners and had a higher likelihood of territory takeover. Our results indicate that early social-environment effects on stress axis programming are mediated byan evolutionary conservedmolecular pathway,which is causally involved in environmentally induced variation of animal social competence.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The nature and taxonomic composition of coral symbiomes as drivers of performance limits in scleractinian corals,"All plants and animals host complex communities of taxonomically diverse microbial assemblages (viruses, Archaea, Bacteria, micro-eukaryotes) that contribute to the functional attributes of the host organism. Scleractinian corals represent particularly provocative subjects for study in this context because they are morphologically complex and associate with a broad diversity of macro invertebrates and vertebrates as well as microorganisms. Representatives of all these taxonomic groupings have been shown to contribute to the function of corals through direct or indirect provisioning and cycling of nutrients, waste removal, defense, and stress tolerance, traits that influence the fitness and environmental thresholds of individual coral colonies. How the taxonomic composition, functional limits and interactive nature of members of these communities vary among and within host species, and scale up to influence community level processes that drive ecosystem structure and function through time and space is unknown; these communities are, however, taxonomically variable among individual corals. Here we draw on the published literature to discuss the ecological and functional significance of the broad and variable taxonomic symbioses found closely associated with corals. Using a comparative approach, we hypothesize that the intra-specific and inter-specific variations in response of corals to environmental disturbance is linked to differences in the specificity, nature and composition of these symbiotic assemblages and reflect variation in the architectural complexity (micro and macro) and capacity of corals to provision habitat. We describe individual coral colonies as symbiomes, unique micro-ecosystems bounded by the physical limits of the coral colony whose performance limits reflect the taxonomic range of the associates (micro and macro) found within the colony. We explicitly recognize the fact that corals represent complex ecological communities composed of organisms that have the potential to compete, as well as interact with one another and the host as commensals, mutualists and parasites, states that likely to be dynamic with nature, context and environment.

Diversity of algal endosymbionts (zooxanthellae) in octocorals: The roles of geography and host relationships,"The presence, genetic identity and diversity of algal endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) in 114 species from 69 genera (20 families) of octocorals from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the far eastern Pacific (EP) and the Caribbean was examined, and patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis were compared with patterns in the host phylogeny. Genetic analyses of the zooxanthellae were based on ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. In the GBR samples, Symbiodinium clades A and G were encountered with A and G being rare. Clade B zooxanthellae have been previously reported from a GBR octocoral, but are also rare in octocorals from this region. Symbiodinium G has so far only been found in Foraminifera, but is rare in these organisms. In the Caribbean samples, only Symbiodinium clades B and C are present. Hence, Symbiodinium diversity at the level of phylogenetic clades is lower in octocorals from the Caribbean compared to those from the GBR. However, an unprecedented level of ITS1 diversity was observed within individual colonies of some Caribbean gorgonians, implying either that these simultaneously harbour multiple strains of clade B zooxanthellae, or that ITS1 heterogeneity exists within the genomes of some zooxanthellae. Intracladal diversity based on ITS should therefore be interpreted with caution, especially in cases where no independent evidence exists to support distinctiveness, such as ecological distribution or physiological characteristics. All samples from EP are azooxanthellate. Three unrelated GBR taxa that are described in the literature as azooxanthellate (Junceella fragilis, Euplexaura nuttingi and Stereonephthya sp. 1) contain clade G zooxanthellae, and their symbiotic association with zooxanthellae was confirmed by histology. These corals are pale in colour, whereas related azooxanthellate species are brightly coloured. The evolutionary loss or gain of zooxanthellae may have altered the light sensitivity of the host tissues, requiring the animals to adopt or reduce pigmentation. Finally, we superimposed patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis onto a molecular phylogeny of the host. The data show that many losses/gains of endosymbiosis have occurred during the evolution of octocorals. The ancestral state (azooxanthellate or zooxanthellate) in octocorals remains unclear, but the data suggest that on an evolutionary timescale octocorals can switch more easily between mixotrophy and heterotrophy compared to scleractinian corals, which coincides with a low reliance on photosynthetic carbon gain in the former group of organisms.  2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",MA96,MW,exclude,,
Evolution of equal division among unequal partners,"One of the hallmarks of human fairness is its insensitivity to power: although strong individuals are often in a position to coerce weak individuals, fairness requires them to share the benefits of cooperation equally. The existence of such egalitarianism is poorly explained by current evolutionary models. We present a model based on cooperation and partner choice that can account for the emergence of a psychological disposition toward fairness, whatever the balance of power between the cooperative partners. We model the evolution of the division of a benefit in an interaction similar to an ultimatum game, in a population made up of individuals of variable strength. The model shows that strong individuals will not receive any advantage from their strength, instead having to share the benefits of cooperation equally with weak individuals at the evolutionary equilibrium, a result that is robust to variations in population size and the proportion of weak individuals. We discuss how this model suggests an explanation for why egalitarian behaviors toward everyone, including the weak, should be more likely to evolve in humans than in any other species.",MA126,MW,include,intraspecific,"cooperation/conflict, modeling"
The effects of behavioral plasticity and leadership on the predictions of optimal skew models,"Skew models predict how reproduction or resources produced by the group are divided between dominant and subordinate group members. These include transactional models, in which one group member may allocate some group productivity to another to prevent group dissolution and tug-of-war inefficiency models, in which group members compete for access to resources at a cost to group productivity. Although skew models involve a transactional or competitive interaction among group members, most existing models do not allow individuals to respond to new information about the strategy of their group mate. Here, I expand transactional and tug-of-war models to allow one individual (the follower) to respond plastically to a fixed strategy of its partner (the leader). I solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium conditions for each model. For the transactional model, leadership results in a greater share of group productivity to the leader compared with models that do not include leadership. When the follower's information about the leader's strategy is perfect, the equilibrium division of productivity does not vary with relatedness, in contrast to the predictions of previous skew models, and the effects of ecological variables may change. In the tug-of-war model, leadership influences equilibrium investment in competition only if relatedness is greater than zero. Dominant leaders receive a larger share of group productivity, but group productivity declines and grouping is mutually beneficial over a smaller parameter range than in the absence of leadership. Subordinate leaders receive a smaller share of group productivity, but benefit from overall higher group productivity.",MA371,MW,exclude,,
Dominant and subordinate outside options alter help and eviction in a pay-to-stay negotiation model,"In several cooperatively breeding species, subordinates that do not help sufficiently are punished or evicted from the group by dominant individuals. The credibility of dominant eviction threats may vary with the social context beyond the group level: when subordinates can easily breed in a neighboring territory, dominants may be less able to demand help from subordinates. Further, dominant ability to enforce subordinate cooperation may be reduced when it is difficult to replace evicted subordinates or in small groups where each subordinate makes a large contribution to group productivity. Here, we develop a 2-player game theoretic model to examine how the social context influences subordinate help and the threshold of help at which dominants evict subordinates. In contrast to predictions, we found that dominants demand more help when dominants are less able to replace evicted subordinates, suggesting that dominants punish a dereliction of helping behavior more strongly when they are unable to compensate for the loss of an evicted subordinate. In single sealed-bid games, subordinates help less than the fitness costs they impose on dominants and help does not vary with subordinate breeding opportunities outside the group. However, when subordinates can plastically increase help in response to demanding dominants (akin to pay-to-stay dynamics), subordinates provide more help overall, but decrease their help as breeding opportunities outside of the group increase. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating negotiation into theoretical models of helping strategies and demonstrate that plasticity is a key mechanism underlying pay-to-stay mechanisms of cooperation.",MA108,MW,exclude,,
"Trade-offs between social learning and individual innovativeness in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus","Social learning and innovation are two different ways to acquire novel behaviours, and the form of the relationship between these two processes strongly affects cultural evolution. Whereas modelling results suggest a negative correlation between the two processes within a species, comparative data show, and the cultural intelligence hypothesis predicts, positive covariation across species. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty about the form of the relationship between social learning and innovation. We explored this problem experimentally in common marmosets. Social learning of 18 subjects was assessed by presenting a video clip of a conspecific demonstrator solving a complex foraging task and comparing their success to a control group. For the same subjects, the propensity to innovate was assessed with two tasks that operationalize different types of innovation: (1) a multistage problem-solving task to estimate goal-directed Type I innovation, that is, the ability to find a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, and (2) a flexibility task testing for more incidental Type II innovation, that is, the propensity to realize and switch to a novel, but easier solution after the establishment of a well-learned solution. Social learning was negatively correlated with Type II innovation, but not with Type I innovation. We discuss these results with regard to competition within an individual of the various attentional processes aimed at conspecifics' behaviour or aspects of the environment, and whether they might be the result of the cooperative breeding system shared by humans and callitrichids.

"Evidence for personality conformity, not social niche specialization in social jays","Animal personality traits are defined as consistent individual differences in behavior over time and across contexts. Occasionally this inflexibility results in maladaptive behavioral responses to external stimuli. However, in social groups inflexible behavioral phenotypes might be favored as this could lead to more predictable social interactions. Two hypotheses seek to describe the optimal distribution of personality types within groups. The social niche specialization hypothesis states that individuals within groups should partition social roles, like personality types, to avoid conflict; whereas the conformity hypothesis states that individuals should assort with conspecifics of similar personality. However, no research so far has compared these hypotheses using data from wild animal systems. We tested boldness in the wild on 2 species with different social systems, the Mexican Jay and California Scrub-Jay. We found support for the conformity hypothesis over the social niche specialization hypothesis because individuals within groups of the social species had more similar personalities, and consequently there was a statistically significant group effect. The most likely mechanism for this conformity is social learning of behaviors through development, but more explicit research on this is needed.",MA122,MW,exclude,,
Accelerated microevolution in an outer membrane protein (OMP) of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia,"Background. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria are key players in the biology of bacterial-host interactions. However, while considerable attention has been given to OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, relatively little is known about the role of these proteins in bacteria that primarily infect invertebrates. One such OMP is found in the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which are widespread symbionts of arthropods and filarial nematodes. Recent experimental studies have shown that the Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) can trigger host immune responses and control cell death programming in humans, suggesting a key role of WSP for establishment and persistence of the symbiosis in arthropods. Results. Here we performed an analysis of 515 unique alleles found in 831 Wolbachia isolates, to investigate WSP structure, microevolution and population genetics. WSP shows an eight-strand transmembrane -barrel structure with four extracellular loops containing hypervariable regions (HVRs). A clustering approach based upon patterns of HVR haplotype diversity was used to group similar WSP sequences and to estimate the relative contribution of mutation and recombination during early stages of protein divergence. Results indicate that although point mutations generate most of the new protein haplotypes, recombination is a predominant force triggering diversity since the very first steps of protein evolution, causing at least 50% of the total amino acid variation observed in recently diverged proteins. Analysis of synonymous variants indicates that individual WSP protein types are subject to a very rapid turnover and that HVRs can accommodate a virtually unlimited repertoire of peptides. Overall distribution of WSP across hosts supports a non-random association of WSP with the host genus, although extensive horizontal transfer has occurred also in recent times. Conclusions. In OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, large recombination impact, positive selection, reduced structural and compositional constraints, and extensive lateral gene transfer are considered hallmarks of evolution in response to the adaptive immune system. However, Wolbachia do not infect vertebrates. Here we predict that the rapid turnover of WSP loop motifs could aid in evading or inhibiting the invertebrate innate immune response. Overall, these features identify WSP as a strong candidate for future studies of host-Wolbachia interactions that affect establishment and persistence of this widespread endosymbiosis.  2010 Baldo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA7,MW,exclude,,
Trait-Based Modeling of Multihost Pathogen Transmission: Plant-Pollinator Networks,"Epidemiological models for multihost pathogen systems often classify individuals taxonomically and use species-specific parameter values, but in species-rich communities that approach may require intractably many parameters. Trait-based epidemiological models offer a potential solution but have not accounted for within-species trait variation or between-species trait overlap. Here we propose and study trait-based models with host and vector communities represented as trait distributions without regard to species identity. To illustrate this approach, we develop susceptible-infectious-susceptible models for disease spread in plant-pollinator networks with continuous trait distributions. We model trait-dependent contact rates in two common scenarios: nested networks and specialized plant-pollinator interactions based on trait matching. We find that disease spread in plant-pollinator networks is impacted the most by selective pollinators, universally attractive flowers, and cospecialized plant-pollinator pairs. When extreme pollinator traits are rare, pollinators with common traits are most important for disease spread, whereas when extreme flower traits are rare, flowers with uncommon traits impact disease spread the most. Greater nestedness and specialization both typically promote disease persistence. Given recent pollinator declines caused in part by pathogens, we discuss how trait-based models could inform conservation strategies for wild and managed pollinators. Furthermore, while we have applied our model to pollinators and pathogens, its framework is general and can be transferred to any kind of species interactions in any community.",MA393,MW,exclude,,
Marine chemical ecology: What's known and what's next?,"In this review, I summarize recent developments in marine chemical ecology and suggest additional studies that should be especially productive. Direct tests in both the field and laboratory show that secondary metabolites commonly function as defenses against consumers. However, some metabolites also diminish fouling, inhibit competitors or microbial pathogens, and serve as gamete attractants; these alternative functions are less thoroughly investigated. We know little about how consumers perceive secondary metabolites or how ecologically realistic doses of defensive metabolites affect consumer physiology or fitness, as opposed to feeding behavior. Secondary metabolites have direct consequences, but they do not act in isolation from other prey characteristics or from the physical and biological environment in which organisms interact with their natural enemies. This mandates that marine chemical ecology be better integrated into a broader and more complex framework that includes aspects of physiological, population, community, and even ecosystem ecology. Recent advances in this area involve assessing how chemically mediated interactions are affected by physical factors such as flow, desiccation, UV radiation, and nutrient availability, or by biological forces such as the palatability or defenses of neighbors, fouling organisms, or microbial symbionts. Chemical defenses can vary dramatically among geographic regions, habitats, individuals within a local habitat, and within different portions of the same individual. Factors affecting this variance are poorly known, but include physical stresses and induction due to previous attack. Studies are needed to assess which consumers induce prey defenses, how responses vary in environments with differing physical characteristics, and whether the `induced' responses are a direct response to consumer attack or are a defense against microbial pathogens invading via feeding wounds. Although relatively unstudied, ontogenetic shifts in concentrations and types of defenses occur in marine species, and patterns of larval chemical defenses appear to provide insights into the evolution of complex life cycles and of differing modes of development among marine invertebrates. The chemical ecology of marine microbes is vastly underappreciated even though microbes produce metabolites that can have devastating indirect effects on non-target organisms (e.g., red tide related fish kills) and significantly affect entire ecosystems. The natural functions of these metabolites are poorly understood, but they appear to deter both consumers and other microbes. Additionally, marine macro-organisms use metabolites from microbial symbionts to deter consumers, subdue prey, and defend their embryos from pathogens.

Modification of insect and arachnid behaviours by vertically transmitted endosymbionts: Infections as drivers of behavioural change and evolutionary novelty,"Vertically acquired, endosymbiotic bacteria such as those belonging to the Rickettsiales and the Mollicutes are known to influence the biology of their arthropod hosts in order to favour their own transmission. In this study we investigate the influence of such reproductive parasites on the behavior of their insects and arachnid hosts. We find that changes in host behavior that are associated with endosymbiont infections are not restricted to characteristics that are directly associated with reproduction. Other behavioural traits, such as those involved in intraspecific competition or in dispersal may also be affected. Such behavioural shifts are expected to influence the level of intraspecific variation and the rate at which adaptation can occur through their effects on effective population size and gene flow amongst populations. Symbionts may thus influence both levels of polymorphism within species and the rate at which diversification can occur.  2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",MA247,MW,include,interspecific,Host-symbiont
Social complementation and growth advantages promote socially defective bacterial isolates,"Social interactions among diverse individuals that encounter one another in nature have often been studied among animals but rarely among microbes. For example, the evolutionary forces that determine natural frequencies of bacteria that express cooperative behaviours at low levels remain poorly understood. Natural isolates of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus sampled from the same fruiting body often vary in social phenotypes, such as group swarming and multicellular development. Here, we tested whether genotypes highly proficient at swarming or development might promote the persistence of less socially proficient genotypes from the same fruiting body. Fast-swarming strains complemented slower isolates, allowing the latter to keep pace with faster strains in mixed groups. During development, one low-sporulating strain was antagonized by high sporulators, whereas others with severe developmental defects had those defects partially complemented by high-sporulating strains. Despite declining in frequency overall during competition experiments spanning multiple cycles of development, developmentally defective strains exhibited advantages during the growth phases of competitions. These results suggest that microbes with low-sociality phenotypes often benefit from interacting with more socially proficient strains. Such complementation may combine with advantages at other traits to increase equilibrium frequencies of low-sociality genotypes in natural populations.  2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

When cooperation begets cooperation: The role of key individuals in galvanizing support,"Life abounds with examples of conspecifics actively cooperating to a common end, despite conflicts of interest being expected concerning how much each individual should contribute. Mathematical models typically find that such conflict can be resolved by partial-response strategies, leading investors to contribute relatively equitably. Using a case study approach, we show that such model expectations can be contradicted in at least four disparate contexts: (i) bi-parental care; (ii) cooperative breeding; (iii) cooperative hunting; and (iv) human cooperation. We highlight that: (a) marked variation in contributions is commonplace; and (b) individuals can often respond positively rather than negatively to the contributions of others. Existing models have surprisingly limited power in explaining these phenomena. Here, we propose that, although among-individual variation in cooperative contributions will be influenced by differential costs and benefits, there is likely to be a strong genetic or epigenetic component. We then suggest that selection can maintain high investors (key individuals) when their contributions promote support by increasing the benefits and/or reducing the costs for others. Our intentions are to raise awareness inand provide testable hypotheses oftwo of the most poorly understood, yet integral, questions regarding cooperative ventures: why do individuas vary in their contributions and when does cooperation beget cooperation?.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Age-dependent change of coalitionary strategy in male Barbary macaques,"Inter-and intra-specific variation in the propensity to form coalitions has been explained by variation in the availability of suitable partners, distribution of fighting ability, coalition profitability, and costs of coordination. Male coalition formation can be an alternative reproductive strategy to one-on-one competition to maximize male reproductive success. Here we focus on age as a state variable to explain within-group variation in individual propensity to form coalitions against other group members. We specifically test the prediction that males conditionally switch from a solo strategy for achievement of high mating success to a cooperative strategy after reaching post-prime age in male Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We combined new observations with data collected in 2006 and 2008 on the same individuals from one captive group living in semi-natural conditions at Affenberg Salem, Germany, and found that in all years males between 5 and 13 years formed significantly fewer coalitions than males 14 years and older (post-prime). More importantly, we found those males that aged into the post-prime phase to have switched their reproductive strategy and to form significantly more coalitions in 2014 compared to 2008. These first longitudinal data together with earlier cross-sectional analyses in this and other primate species suggest that group-level measures of coalition propensity may be strongly affected by the age composition of groups and that male coalition formation can be a conditional reproductive strategy.

Antagonistic evolution in an aposematic predator-prey signaling system,"Warning signals within species, such as the bright colors of chemically defended animals, are usually considered mutualistic, monomorphic traits. Such a view is however increasingly at odds with the growing empirical literature, showing nontrivial levels of signal variation within prey populations. Key to understanding this variation, we argue, could be a recognition that toxicity levels frequently vary within populations because of environmental heterogeneity. Inequalities in defense may undermine mutualistic monomorphic signaling, causing evolutionary antagonism between loci that determine appearance of less well-defended and better defended prey forms within species. In this article, we apply a stochastic model of evolved phenotypic plasticity to the evolution of prey signals. We show that when toxicity levels vary, then antagonistic interactions can lead to evolutionary conflict between alleles at different signaling loci, causing signal evolution, ``red queen-like{''} evolutionary chase, and one or more forms of signaling equilibria. A key prediction is that variation in the way that predators use information about toxicity levels in their attack behaviors profoundly affects the evolutionary characteristics of the prey signaling systems. Environmental variation is known to cause variation in many qualities that organisms signal; our approach may therefore have application to other signaling systems.",MA18,MW,include,intraspecific/interspecific,Predator-prey
Distinct Molecular Strategies for Hox-Mediated Limb Suppression in Drosophila: From Cooperativity to Dispensability/Antagonism in TALE Partnership,"The emergence following gene duplication of a large repertoire of Hox paralogue proteins underlies the importance taken by Hox proteins in controlling animal body plans in development and evolution. Sequence divergence of paralogous proteins accounts for functional specialization, promoting axial morphological diversification in bilaterian animals. Yet functionally specialized paralogous Hox proteins also continue performing ancient common functions. In this study, we investigate how highly divergent Hox proteins perform an identical function. This was achieved by comparing in Drosophila the mode of limb suppression by the central (Ultrabithorax and AbdominalA) and posterior class (AbdominalB) Hox proteins. Results highlight that Hox-mediated limb suppression relies on distinct modes of DNA binding and a distinct use of TALE cofactors. Control of common functions by divergent Hox proteins, at least in the case studied, relies on evolving novel molecular properties. Thus, changes in protein sequences not only provide the driving force for functional specialization of Hox paralogue proteins, but also provide means to perform common ancient functions in distinct ways.  2013 Sambrani et al.",MA93,MW,exclude,,
Cooperation and conflict in the evolution of individuality .1. Multilevel selection of the organism,"This article studies the transition in evolution from cells to multicellular organisms. The issues considered are applicable to all major transitions in the units of evolution that share two themes: the emergence of cooperation and the regulation of conflict among the lower-level units, in this case, cells. Explicit genetic models of mutation and selection both within and between organisms are studied in sexual and asexual haploid and diploid organisms without a germ line. The results may be understood in terms of the differing opportunities for within-and between-organism selection under the different reproductive modes and parameter values. Cooperation among cells increases when the fitness covariance at the level of the organism overcomes within-organism change toward defecting cells. Selection and mutation during development generate significant levels of within-organism variation and lead to significant variation in organism fitness at equilibrium. The levels of cooperativity attained can be low, even with reproduction passing through a single-cell zygote stage and the high kinship that entails. Sex serves to maintain higher levels of cooperation and lower levels of within-organism change. Fixed size may help organisms reduce conflict among cells.",MA77,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
State-dependent parasitism by a facultative parasite of fruit flies,"Parasites can evolve phenotypically plastic strategies for transmission such that a single genotype can give rise to a range of phenotypes depending on the environmental condition. State-dependent plasticity in particular can arise from individual differences in the parasite's internal state or the condition of the host. Facultative parasites serve as ideal model systems for investigating state-dependent plasticity because individuals can exhibit two life history strategies (free-living or parasitic) depending on the environment. Here, we experimentally show that the ectoparasitic mite Macrocheles subbadius is more likely to parasitize a fruit fly host if the female mite is mated; furthermore, the propensity to infect increased with the level of starvation experienced by the mite. Host condition also played an important role; hosts infected with moderate mite loads were more likely to gain additional infections in pairwise choice tests than uninfected flies. We also found that mites preferentially infected flies subjected to mechanical injury over uninjured flies. These results suggest that a facultative parasite's propensity to infect a host (i.e. switch from a free-living strategy) depends on both the parasite's internal state and host condition. Parasites often live in highly variable and changing environments, an infection strategy that is plastic is likely to be adaptive.

Rethinking Mutualism Stability: Cheaters and the Evolution of Sanctions,"How cooperation originates and persists in diverse species, from bacteria to multicellular organisms to human societies, is a major question in evolutionary biology. A large literature asks: what prevents selection for cheating within cooperative lineages? In mutualisms, or cooperative interactions between species, feedback between partners often aligns their fitness interests, such that cooperative symbionts receive more benefits from their hosts than uncooperative symbionts. But how do these feedbacks evolve? Cheaters might invade symbiont populations and select for hosts that preferentially reward or associate with cooperators (often termed sanctions or partner choice); hosts might adapt to variation in symbiont quality that does not amount to cheating (e.g., environmental variation); or conditional host responses might exist before cheaters do, making mutualisms stable from the outset. I review evidence from yucca-yucca moth, fig-fig wasp, and legume-rhizobium mutualisms, which are commonly cited as mutualisms stabilized by sanctions. Based on the empirical evidence, it is doubtful that cheaters select for host sanctions in these systems; cheaters are too uncommon. Recognizing that sanctions likely evolved for functions other than retaliation against cheaters offers many insights about mutualism coevolution, and about why mutualism evolves in only some lineages of potential hosts.",MA310,MW,include,interspecific,Host-symbiont
Bacterial Biodiversity,"Bacterial diversity comprises the total variability of prokaryotic life on Earth, covering all genomic, phenetic, phylogenetic, and ecological variations from the level of an individual strain to the community that evolved over a time span of probably more than 3.5 billion years. Determination of the extent of diversity is mainly restricted to cultured prokaryotes because the vast majority of strains are not yet accessible for subsequent research. Strains involved in obligate symbiotic and parasitic relationships with their eukaryotic hosts and free-living strains for which appropriate culture conditions have not been developed can at best be detected by molecular techniques.

Some evolutionary aspects of the food-procuring group behavior in phylogenesis of primates,"The peculiarities were studied of the intragroup competitive and cooperative behavior of primates differing by the level of phylogenetic development, beginning from low-organized species of the higher primates to high-organized anthropoid monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Cebus apella, Macaca mulatto, Papio hamaofrijas, Pan troglodytes). It has been shown that in all monkeys, under conditions of competitive feeding situation, there were changes of the complex behavioral forms observed at individual learning. Under conditions of the activity in pairs, the females of platyrrhine (New World) and lower narrow-nose (Old World) monkeys lost the possibility to realize the skill and food needs, so the programmed tasks were solved predominantly by the males. In chimpanzees, the change of indices of instrumental activity involved to the equal degree the male and female, and solution of the alternation task was higher in individual experiments. The age differences were revealed in the competitive behavior of chimpanzees in group. The realization of formed skills depended on the complex of factors including the requirements dominating in the given situation and the age and typological peculiarities, as well as the social rank of each monkey in the community. In rhesus macaques the capability for cooperative interaction was revealed under conditions of complex operant activity.",MA342,MW,exclude,,
"Spider mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) mitochondrial COI phylogeny reviewed: Host plant relationships, phylogeography, reproductive parasites and barcoding","The past 15 years have witnessed a number of molecular studies that aimed to resolve issues of species delineation and phylogeny of mites in the family Tetranychidae. The central part of the mitochondrial COI region has frequently been used for investigating intra- and interspecific variation. All these studies combined yield an extensive database of sequence information of the family Tetranychidae. We assembled this information in a single alignment and performed an overall phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogeny shows that important patterns have been overlooked in previous studies, whereas others disappear. It also reveals that mistakes were made in submitting the data to GenBank, which further disturbed interpretation of the data. Our total analysis clearly shows three clades that most likely correspond to the species T. urticae, T. kanzawai and T. truncatus. Intraspecific variation is very high, possibly due to selective sweeps caused by reproductive parasites. We found no evidence for host plant associations and phylogeographic patterns in T. urticae are absent. Finally we evaluate the application of DNA barcoding.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",MA349,MW,exclude,,
Models of density-dependent genic selection and a new rock-paper-scissors social system,"We describe new ESS models of density regulation driven by genic selection to explain the cyclical dynamics of a social system that exhibits a rock-paper-scissors (RPS) set of three alternative strategies. We tracked changes in morph frequency and fitness of Lacerta vivipara and found conspicuous RPS cycles. Morphs of Uta and Lacerta exhibited parallel survival-performance trade-offs. Frequency cycles in both species of lizards are driven by genic selection. In Lacerta, frequency of each allele in adult cohorts had significant impacts on juvenile recruitment, similar to mutualistic, altruistic, and antagonistic relations of RPS alleles in Uta. We constructed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models in which adults impact juvenile recruitment as a function of self versus nonself color recognition. ESS models suggest that the rapid 4-year RPS cycles exhibited by Lacerta are not possible unless three factors are present: behaviors evolve that discriminate self versus nonself morphs at higher rates than random, self- versus non-self-recognition contributes to density regulation, and context-dependent mate choice evolves in females, which choose sire genotypes to enhance progeny survival. We suggest genic selection coupled to density regulation is widespread and thus fundamental to theories of social system evolution as well as theories of population regulation in diverse animal taxa.",MA246,MW,include,intraspecific,various interactions
"Metabolic diversity and niche structure in sponges from the Miskito Cays, Honduras","Hosting symbionts provides many eukaryotes with access to the products of microbial metabolism that are crucial for host performance. On tropical coral reefs, many (High Microbial Abundance [HMA]) but not all (Low Microbial Abundance [LMA]) marine sponges host abundant symbiont communities. Although recent research has revealed substantial variation in these sponge-microbe associations (termed holobionts), little is known about the ecological implications of this diversity. We investigated the expansion of diverse sponge species across isotopic niche space by calculating niche size (as standard ellipse area [SEA<inf>c</inf>]) and assessing the relative placement of common sponge species in bivariate (13C and 15N) plots. Sponges for this study were collected from the relatively isolated reefs within the Miskito Cays of Honduras. These reefs support diverse communities of HMA and LMA species that together span a gradient of photosymbiont abundance, as revealed by chlorophyll a analysis. HMA sponges occupied unique niche space compared to LMA species, but the placement of some HMA sponges was driven by photosymbiont abundance. In addition, photosymbiont abundance explained a significant portion of the variation in isotope values, suggesting that access to autotrophic metabolism provided by photosymbionts is an important predictor in the location of species within isotopic space. Host identity accounted for over 70% of the variation in isotope values within the Miskito Cays and there was substantial variation in the placement of individual species within isotopic niche space, suggesting that holobiont metabolic diversity may allow taxonomically diverse sponge species to utilize unique sources of nutrients within a reef system. This study provides initial evidence that microbial symbionts allow sponges to expand into novel physiochemical niche space. This expansion may reduce competitive interactions within coral reefs and promote diversification of these communities.  2014 Freeman et al.",MA242,MW,exclude,,
Social cohesion in yellow-bellied marmots is established through age and kin structuring,"Individual characteristics and choices can influence social structure in animal groups. Social behaviour is likely to change throughout an individual's life, resulting in different social roles at different ages. Individuals may also choose to interact differently with others based on their age, sex or kinship. We used social network analysis to examine biological correlates of individual social variation in free-living groups of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. To measure social variation, we chose network measures that reflect an individual's tendency to initiate or receive both direct and indirect interactions. We asked how age, sex and kinship influenced patterns of affiliative ( socially cohesive) and agonistic ( socially competitive) interactions. Specifically, we predicted that individuals would vary in their tendency to initiate and receive interactions according to these characteristics, and that they would be more likely to interact affiliatively with more similar individuals and to interact agonistically with more dissimilar individuals. We found that patterns of direct and indirect interactions changed significantly with age, with younger animals being more involved in affiliative interactions and older animals initiating more agonistic ones. Furthermore, affiliative networks tended to be structured by age and kinship. Our results suggest that yearling yellow-bellied marmots are more important for maintaining social cohesion than has previously been recognized, and that marmot colonies are largely organized based on age group and kinship.

Foraging strategy predicts foraging economy in a facultative secondary nectar robber,"In mutualistic interactions, the decision whether to cooperate or cheat depends on the relative costs and benefits of each strategy. In pollination mutualisms, secondary nectar robbing is a facultative behavior employed by a diverse array of nectar-feeding organisms, and is thought to be a form of cheating. Primary robbers create holes in floral tissue through which they feed on nectar, whereas secondary robbers, which often lack chewing mouthparts, feed on nectar through existing holes. Because primary robbers make nectar more readily available to secondary robbers, primary robbers facilitate the behaviors of secondary robbers. However, the net effect of facilitation on secondary robber fitness has not been empirically tested: it is unknown whether the benefit secondary robbers receive is strong enough to overcome the cost of competing with primary robbers for a shared resource. We conducted foraging experiments using the bumble bee Bombus bifarius, which can alternatively forage legitimately' (from the floral opening) or secondary-rob. We measured the relative foraging efficiencies (handling time per flower, flowers visited per minute, proportion of foraging bout spent consuming nectar) of these alternative behaviors, and tested whether the frequency of primary robbing and nectar standing crop in primary-robbed flowers of Linaria vulgaris (Plantaginaceae) affected foraging efficiency. Surprisingly, there was no effect of primary robbing frequency on the foraging efficiency of secondary-robbing B. bifarius. Instead, foraging strategy was a major predictor of foraging efficiency, with legitimate foraging being significantly more efficient than secondary robbing. Legitimate foraging was the more common strategy used by B. bifarius in our study; however, it is rarely used by B. bifarius foraging on L. vulgaris in nature, despite indications that it is more efficient. Our results suggest the need for deeper investigations into why bees adopt secondary robbing as a foraging strategy, specifically, the environmental contexts that promote the behavior.",MA153,MW,include,interspecific,Plant-pollinator
Plant geographic phenotypic variation drives diversification in its associated community of a phytophagous insect and its parasitoids,"Background: While the communities constituted by phytophageous insects and their parasites may represent half of all terrestrial animal species, understanding their diversification remains a major challenge. A neglected idea is that geographic phenotypic variation in a host plant may lead to heterogeneous evolutionary responses of the different members of the associated communities. This could result in diversification on a host plant by ecological speciation in some species, leading to geographic variation in community composition. In this study we investigated geographic variation of inflorescence receptacle size in a plant, Ficus hirta, and how the hymenopteran community feeding in the inflorescences has responded. Our predictions were: 1) Inflorescence size variation affects wasp species differently depending on how they access oviposition sites. 2) In some affected lineages of wasps, we may observe vicariant, parapatric species adapted to different inflorescence sizes. Results: We show that fig (the enclosed inflorescence of Ficus) wall thickness varies geographically. The fig entering pollinating wasp was not affected, while the parasites ovipositing through the fig wall were. Two parapatric species of Philotrypesis, exhibiting strikingly different ovipositor lengths, were recorded. One species of Sycoscapter was also present, and it was restricted, like the shorter-ovipositor Philotrypesis, to the geographic zone where fig walls were thinner. Conclusions: Previous work on fig wasps suggested that parapatric geographic ranges among congenerics were due to adaptation to variation in abiotic factors, complemented by interspecific competition. Our results show that parapatric ranges may also result from adaptation to variation in biotic factors. Within an insect community, differences among species in their response to geographic phenotypic variation of their host plant may result in geographically heterogeneous community structure. Such heterogeneity leads to heterogeneous interaction networks among sites. Our results support the hypothesis that plant geographic phenotypic variation can be a driver of diversification in associated insect communities, and can complement other diversification processes.",MA282,MW,exclude,,
Policing and punishment across the domains of social evolution,"Several decades of research in humans, other vertebrates, and social insects have offered fascinating insights into the dynamics of punishment (and its subset, policing), but authors have only rarely addressed whether there are fundamental joint principles underlying the maintenance of these behaviors. Here we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punishing roles in animal societies. We apply our scheme to societies of eusocial Hymenoptera and nonhuman vertebrate social breeders, and we outline potential extensions for understanding conflict regulation among cells in metazoan bodies and unrelated individuals in human societies. We highlight that: 1) no social unit is expected to express punishment behavior unless it collects positive inclusive fitness benefits that surpass alternative benefits of bystanding; 2) punishment with public good benefits can be maintained through either direct fitness benefits (coercion) or indirect fitness benefits (correction) or both; 3) differences across social systems in the distributions of power, relatedness, and reproductive options drive variation in the extent to which individuals actively punish; and 4) inclusive fitness logic captures many punishment-relevant evolutionary and ecological variables in a single framework that appears to apply across very different types of social arrangements. Synthesis Researchers have long observed that individuals in animal societies punish (and by extension, police) each other, but they have rarely investigated whether general principles underlie this behavior across social arrangements. In this paper, we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punisher roles in animal societies. We apply the approach to eusocial insects and cooperatively breeding vertebrates and outline extensions towards the control of cancer cell lineages and punishment in human groups. We highlight how variation in specific social variables may drive differences in punishing/policing across the social domains.  2015 The Authors.",MA287,MW,include,intraspecific,punishment
Isolation of naturally associated bacteria of necromenic Pristionchus nematodes and fitness consequences,"Nematodes and bacteria are major components of the soil ecosystem. Many nematodes use bacteria for food, whereas others evolved specialized bacterial interactions ranging from mutualism to parasitism. Little is known about the biological mechanisms by which nematode - bacterial interactions are achieved, largely because in the laboratory nematodes are often cultured under artificial conditions. We investigated the bacterial interactions of nematodes from the genus Pristionchus that have a strong association with scarab beetles. Pristionchus has a different feeding strategy than Caenorhabditis and meta-genomic 16S sequence analysis of Pristionchus individuals showed a diversity of living bacteria within the nematode gut and on the nematode cuticle. Twenty-three different bacterial strains were isolated from three Pristionchus - beetle associations and were used to study nematode - bacterial interactions under controlled laboratory conditions. We show a continuum of bacterial interactions from dissemination, to reduction in brood size and nematode mortality caused by bacteria derived from insect hosts. Olfactory discrimination experiments show distinct chemoattraction and fitness profiles of Pristionchus nematodes when exposed to different bacteria. For example, Pristionchus pacificus avoids Serratia marcescens possibly because of pathogenicity. Also, P. pacificus avoids Bacillus thuringiensis and insect pathogenic bacteria but is resistant to the human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, unlike Caenorhabditis elegans. Pristionchus specifically recognize and respond to bacteria that cause ill health. Bringing the nematode - bacterial interaction into the laboratory allows detailed functional studies, including the genetic manipulation of the interaction in both nematodes and bacteria.",MA226,MW,exclude,,
How individual and relative size affect participation in territorial defense and cortisol levels in a social fish,"For many species, behaviors such as territory defense and parental care are energetically costly, but are nonetheless can provide substantial fitness gains. In systems in which both parents provide parental care, each of the parents benefits from exhibiting (or having their partner exhibit) these behaviors. However, in many cases, costs and benefits differ between parents due to factors such as size or sex. Different intruder types may also impose different costs on parents. Predatory intruders might consume offspring, whereas conspecifics might threaten the social status of a parent, or provide benefits as a potential group joiner or mate. Responses to these intrusions may also be associated with variation in individual stress responses. We investigated associations among male and female sizes, and the interaction between these, with defense against conspecific and heterospecific territorial intruders by members of successfully breeding pairs in the cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We also investigated whether cortisol levels were associated with size or participation in territory defense because each may be a cause or consequence of individual variation in the stress response. We found that females paired with large males performed fewer defensive behaviors than females paired with smaller males. Males paired with relatively large females had higher baseline cortisol levels than those paired with smaller females. Collectively, individual characteristics such as size have consequences for each individual's behavior, and also influence the behavior, and endocrine state of social partners.",MA188,MW,include,intraspecific,Male-female
Ant stoichiometry: elemental homeostasis in stage-structured colonies,"1. Organisms facing variation in food quality maintain elemental composition within limited bounds. Such stoichiometric homeostasis has often been considered a species-specific parameter, but stoichiometry can also vary intraspecifically across life stages, sexes and sizes. In colonial organisms with overlapping generations, stoichiometric variation among stages could lead to flexibility in colony-level elemental composition due to changes in internal demography 2. We examine how the balance of energy (sucrose) and nutrients (prey) affects growth rate and carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) homeostasis in a eusocial insect, the pavement ant Tetramorium caespitum. 3. Colony growth depended heavily on prey availability. However, sucrose scarcity led to higher worker mortality and production of smaller workers, suggesting sucrose availability will affect colony-level performance in a competitive environment. 4. In contrast, C : N : P stoichiometry of larvae, pupae, and workers varied mostly with sucrose availability. Biomass P content within life stages was lower in colonies receiving less access to sucrose. We suggest this difference arose primarily from shifts in individual ant mass coupled with negative P-body mass relationships. 5. Life stages differed considerably in elemental composition, and resource conditions affected colony stage structure. Nevertheless, variation in colony-level stoichiometry primarily reflected compositional differences within stages rather than shifts in internal demography.",MA17,MW,exclude,,
PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIATION IN ANIMALS,"Numerous examples are cited of physiological characters which, like morphological characters, vary genotypically, ontogenetically or phenotypically. Physiological variation is useful in describing interspecific relations, intraspecific variation and the limits of ecological range. Physiological variation of a character permits the establishment of populations at environmental limits and thus predisposes a race for genetic fixation of a character (Baldwin effect). Such variation is primary in providing one mechanism of reproductive isolation. Secondary physiological variation functions in habitat selection, particularly after reproductive isolation. Criteria for physiological variation are given by measurement of internal state in relation to environmental stress. In regulators a criterion is the point of failure of homeostatic mechanisms; in adjusters a criterion is the limit of tolerance after maximum acclimation. Both regulation and adjustment are adaptive to environmental change; in both types, phenotypic variation must be distinguished from genotypic variation. Examples of physiological variation in osmotic adaptation, in different populations of the same species, are given for species of Paramecium, Euplotes, Asterias, Gammarus, Callinectes, Anopheles, Onchorhynchus and Gasterosteus. Genetically different races have been established for Gasterosteus aculeatus and Euplotes vassus. Ionic balance has been little studied as a basis for variation of populations but specific requirements for some elements, such as copper and calcium, may have led to local differences. Stress of temperature extremes has induced many physiological variants. Closely related large homoiotherms differ in insulating capacity, smaller species differ also in metabolic response, particularly to cold. Poikilotherms differ in tolerance limits after acclimation, in selected temperatures, in metabolic level according to their temperature history, in Q 10 , in critical temperatures for reproduction and development. Physiological races with respect to temperature tolerance or selection are cited for species of Notropis, Micropterus, Gambusia, Pandalus and Carabus. Examples of metabolic differences in populations are found in aquatic but not terrestrial poikilotherms. Examples of races with respect to optimal temperature of development are found in species of Paramecium, Crassostrea, Urosalpinx, Daphnia, Drosophila, Lymantria and Rana. Criteria of variation with respect to oxygen are the halfsaturation value of transport pigments, the critical oxygen concentration, metabolic level, tolerance of products of anaerobiosis, auxiliary breathing mechanisms and stimulation of pigment development by hypoxia. Correlations of these functions with history of oxygen availability are cited, but data are inadequate to establish genetic races. Selection of specific food plants depends on secondary products, not primary food; many subspecies and races are known by food plant selection, especially among bugs, gall flies and butterflies. Preference can be transferred from one plant to another by forcedfeeding habituation; a food habit can be transmitted by behaviour from one generation to the next, or it may be fixed by genetic differences. Many genetic strains resistant to natural and artificial poisons are known. Light is an isolating mechanism for cave animals, for races differing in phototaxes, for races and related species differing in pigmentation and in establishing photoperiodic cycles. Variation in tolerance of type of substratum, of stream and of wind velocity isolates in some species. Examples of isolation by reproductive behaviour are given in crickets, Drosophila, birds and other groups. Selection of host by parasites and symbionts is a subtle isolating mechanism, probably based largely on chemical specificity. Serological incompatibility is a secondary mechanism in maintaining genetic intersterility. Physiological variation is usually accompanied by detectable morphological variation which may or may not be adaptive. Reproductive isolation may exist with slight physiological or morphological variation or conversely interbreeding may occur among very different populations. Need for physiological study of intraspecific variation according to history and distribution of natural populations is stressed. Copyright  1955, Wiley Blackwell.

Transitivity and structural balance in marmot social networks,"Social relationships are composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions, representing opposing effects. Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a weak definition of structural balance is probably more common than strong structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance. Our study suggests that there are intriguing similarities in social processes across diverse animal societies and that studying triads and network motifs may help identify basic social mechanisms linking local to global structure.Significance statementSocial network theory predicts that basic social mechanisms should lead to similar structural properties across different societies. For example, positive relationships should be transitive (a friend of a friend is a friend), and certain combinations of positive and negative relationships represent conflict and should be unstable over time (e.g., a friend of a friend being an enemy is an unstable state). This latter theory, called structural balance, has rarely been examined in nonhuman societies; hence, we tested for transitivity and structural balance in groups of free-living yellow-bellied marmots. Positive interactions were generally transitive, but evidence for structural balance was inconsistent. Furthermore, group composition could affect network transitivity, and small network size (associated with few interactions) limits ability to detect significant patterns. Our results suggest that transitivity is fundamental in structuring positive relationships, while some forms of structural balance are present but not widespread.",MA395,MW,exclude,,
Communal singing in the cooperatively breeding subdesert mesite Monias benschi: Evidence of numerical assessment?,"It has long been suggested that competing groups of social animals assess one another on the basis of communal vocalisations, but so far this has only been demonstrated in mammals. We investigated this idea in the subdesert mesite, a group-living bird that produces communal songs during aggressive territorial interactions with other groups. Where groups compete as units, differences in group size might outweigh inter-individual differences in determining the outcome of contests. Given this species' variable social system, we predicted that the composition of groups would also influence their resource holding potential. Playback experiments showed that the number of simulated intruders significantly influenced the strength of response by defending groups hearing the stimulus: groups were less likely to approach but gave more protracted and more communal vocal responses as the number of vocalising intruders increased. We found that the likelihood of a group approaching playback increased as the ratio between the number of males in the defending group and the number of males in the intruding group increased. Furthermore, the ratio of adult males to females in the defending group significantly affected the probability of approach, with the probability increasing as groups became more male-biased. This finding supports the idea that the social structure of groups may be important in determining the outcome of contests between groups. Overall this study provides some indication in birds of relative numerical assessment based on vocal cues.",MA55,MW,exclude,,
"Linking neuroethology to the chemical biology of natural products: interactions between cone snails and their fish prey, a case study","From a biological perspective, a natural product can be defined as a compound evolved by an organism for chemical interactions with another organism including prey, predator, competitor, pathogen, symbiont or host. Natural products hold tremendous potential as drug leads and have been extensively studied by chemists and biochemists in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the biological purpose for which a natural product evolved is rarely addressed. By focusing on a well-studied group of natural products-venom components from predatory marine cone snails-this review provides a rationale for why a better understanding of the evolution, biology and biochemistry of natural products will facilitate both neuroscience and the potential for drug leads. The larger goal is to establish a new sub-discipline in the broader field of neuroethology that we refer to as ``Chemical Neuroethology{''}, linking the substantial work carried out by chemists on natural products with accelerating advances in neuroethology.",MA233,MW,exclude,,
The extended personality: indirect effects of behavioural syndromes on the behaviour of others in a group-living cichlid,"Consistent individual variation in behaviour is widespread across taxa and behavioural categories. Because social behaviour is often a plastic response to the social environment, consistent variation in social behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group. In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social environment and may be an important selective influence on social behaviour and on variation among social groups.

Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control,"Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive controla set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasksa Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figureseach with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.  2018 Khambhati et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",MA356,MW,exclude,,
"Personality and intelligence: Persistence, not self-directedness, cooperativeness or self-transcendence, is related to twins' cognitive abilities","Background. A person-centered approach focusing on the interaction of an individual's temperament-character-life events is essential in the path of individuals' well-being. In this context, three character traits, Self-directedness (e.g., self-acceptance, self-control, goal-directed behavior), Cooperativeness (e.g., social affiliation, social tolerance, empathy and helpfulness) and Self-transcendence (e.g., spiritual acceptance, transpersonal identification), measured using Cloninger's model of personality are suggested to help the individual to regulate and resolve the conflicts derived from her/his temperament combinations as a reaction to life events. However, if character is related to the individual's cognitive ability, then this association might limit any intervention that focuses on character development. We used data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) to investigate the relationship between personality and cognitive ability. Method. The sample consisted of 370 15-year-old twins (159 girls/211 boys), 192 of whomscreen-positive with various types of mental health problems. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to measure personality and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV) to measure intelligence. The relationship was investigated using correlation analyses using random-selected twins from each dyad and separately for monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Additional analyses investigated the genetic and environmental effects on personality and cognitive ability in this specific sample. Results. There were no significant correlations between the WISC-IV indices and any of the character traits (i.e., Self-directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-transcendence). Persistence was significantly related, if weak, to four WISC-IV indices: Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and the Full WISC-IV Scale. Post-hoc cross-twin/cross-trait analyses showed that the Persistence-cognitive ability correlation might depend on common genetic effects. The WISC-IV indices showed a relatively large genetic influence, while earlier findings about the etiology of temperament and character traits using the whole CATSS sample were replicated in this sub-sample of twins. Conclusions. The results indicate that what individuals make of themselves intentionally (i.e., their character) was not associated to intelligence. Persistence, a temperament dimension that measures heritable individual differences in eagerness of effort, ambition, perfectionism, and resistance to discouragement despite frustration and fatigue, was weakly linked to intelligence. Suggesting that, at least during adolescence, interventions targeting character development are not limited by the individual's intelligence.  2015 Mousavi et al.",MA276,MW,exclude,,
Global associations between birds and vane-dwelling feather mites,"Understanding host-symbiont networks is a major question in evolutionary ecology. Birds host a great diversity of endo- and ectosymbiotic organisms, with feather mites (Arachnida: Acariformes: Analgoidea, Pterolichoidea) being among the most diverse of avian symbionts. A global approach to the ecology and evolution of bird-feather-mite associations has been hampered because of the absence of a centralized data repository. Here we present the most extensive data set of associations between feather mites and birds. Data include 12 036 records of 1887 feather mite species located on the flight feathers of 2234 bird species from 147 countries. Feather mites typically located inside quills, on the skin, or on downy body feathers are not included. Data were extracted from 493 published sources dating from 1882 to 2015. Data exploration shows that although most continents and bird families are represented, most bird species remain unexplored for feather mites. Nevertheless, this is the most comprehensive data set available for enabling global macroecological analyses of feather mites and their hosts, such as ecological network analyses.

Cooperation promotes the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites with unitary growth,"Most animals have specialized into separate sexes but most plants remain hermaphroditic. The underlining cause for this is still unclear. Here we address this question by evolutionary stable strategy analysis and exact calculation of frequency-dependent selection and genetic drift in geographically structured populations. Reproductive investments of hermaphrodites are divided into male and female functions, and each sex requires linear investments that increase linearly with successful gamete number and reusable investments (RIs) that increase less than linearly. Individuals specializing into one sex require RIs of only this sex and thus can produce more gametes. However, these gametes suffer strong kin competition as they are of the same sex and gamete number of the other sex decreases. The success of individuals specializing into one sex requires individuals specializing into the other sex to cooperate with them, providing them with more opposite-sex gametes and relaxing them of the same-sex competition. The evolution of this cooperation does not require two rare mutations to happen simultaneously at the same place, because single-sex mutants can sparsely spread in a hermaphroditic population with RIs despite genetic drift and wait for mutants of the other sex to arise. RI resembles fixed cost in previous theories. However, previous theories considered all costs except for costs for gametes as fixed costs and this does not capture an important plant-animal difference; modular growth of sexual organs in most plants and some animals promotes reproductive investments to increase linearly with offspring number, so their investments in sexual organs are linear investments rather than fixed costs. This study shows the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites as an example of the evolution of cooperation and mutualism as in harmony games, and highlights modular growth as an important factor that prevents most plants and some animals from evolving into separate sexes.

The histone variant H2A.Z and chromatin remodeler BRAHMA act coordinately and antagonistically to regulate transcription and nucleosome dynamics in Arabidopsis,"Plants adapt to environmental changes by regulating transcription and chromatin organization. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z and the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) have overlapping roles in positively and negatively regulating environmentally responsive genes in Arabidopsis, but the extent of this overlap was uncharacterized. Both factors have been associated with various changes in nucleosome positioning and stability in different contexts, but their specific roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization need further characterization. We show that H2A.Z and BRM co-localize at thousands of sites, where they interact both cooperatively and antagonistically in transcriptional repression and activation of genes involved in development and responses to environmental stimuli. We identified eight classes of genes that show distinct relationships between H2A.Z and BRM with respect to their roles in transcription. These include activating and silencing transcription both redundantly and antagonistically. We found that H2A.Z contributes to a range of different nucleosome properties, while BRM stabilizes nucleosomes where it binds and destabilizes or repositions flanking nucleosomes. We also found that, at many genes regulated by both BRM and H2A.Z, both factors overlap with binding sites of the light-regulated transcription factor FAR1-Related Sequence 9 (FRS9) and that a subset of these FRS9 binding sites are dependent on H2A.Z and BRM for accessibility. Collectively, we comprehensively characterized the antagonistic and cooperative contributions of H2A.Z and BRM to transcriptional regulation, and illuminated several interrelated roles in chromatin organization. The variability observed in their individual functions implies that both BRM and H2A.Z have more context-dependent roles than previously assumed.  2019 The Authors The Plant Journal  2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",MA378,MW,exclude,,
"Host-symbiont-pathogen interactions in blood-feeding parasites: Nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange","Animals are common hosts of mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Blood-feeding parasites feed on a diet that is nutritionally unbalanced and thus often rely on symbionts to supplement essential nutrients. However, they are also of medical importance as they can be infected by pathogens such as bacteria, protists or viruses that take advantage of the blood-feeding nutritional strategy for own transmission. Since blood-feeding evolved multiple times independently in diverse animals, it showcases a gradient of host-microbe interactions. While some parasitic lineages are possibly asymbiotic and manage to supplement their diet from other food sources, other lineages are either loosely associated with extracellular gut symbionts or harbour intracellular obligate symbionts that are essential for the host development and reproduction. What is perhaps even more diverse are the pathogenic lineages that infect blood-feeding parasites. This microbial diversity not only puts the host into a complicated situation -distinguishing between microorganisms that can greatly decrease or increase its fitness -but also increases opportunity for horizontal gene transfer to occur in this environment. In this review, I first introduce this diversity of mutualistic and pathogenic microorganisms associated with blood-feeding animals and then focus on patterns in their interactions, particularly nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange.  2018 Cambridge University Press.",MA185,MW,exclude,,
Cooperative personalities and social niche specialization in female meerkats,"The social niche specialization hypothesis predicts that group-living animals should specialize in particular social roles to avoid social conflict, resulting in alternative life-history strategies for different roles. Social niche specialization, coupled with role-specific life-history trade-offs, should thus generate between-individual differences in behaviour that persist through time, or distinct personalities, as individuals specialize in particular nonoverlapping social roles. We tested for support for the social niche specialization hypothesis in cooperative personality traits in wild female meerkats (Suricata suricatta) that compete for access to dominant social roles. As cooperation is costly and dominance is acquired by heavier females, we predicted that females that ultimately acquired dominant roles would show noncooperative personality types early in life and before and after role acquisition. Although we found large individual differences in repeatable cooperative behaviours, there was no indication that individuals that ultimately acquired dominance differed from unsuccessful individuals in their cooperative behaviour. Early-life behaviour did not predict social role acquisition later in life, nor was cooperative behaviour before and after role acquisition correlated in the same individuals. We suggest that female meerkats do not show social niche specialization resulting in cooperative personalities, but that they exhibit an adaptive response in personality at role acquisition.  2014 The Authors.",MA81,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
Fluorescent proteins function as a prey attractant: Experimental evidence from the hydromedusa Olindias formosus and other marine organisms,"Although proteins in the green fluorescent protein family (GFPs) have been discovered in a wide array of taxa, their ecological functions in these organisms remain unclear. Many hypothesized roles are related to modifying bioluminescence spectra or modulating the light regime for algal symbionts, but these do not explain the presence of GFPs in animals that are non-luminous and non-symbiotic. Other hypothesized functions are unrelated to the visual signals themselves, including stress responses and antioxidant roles, but these cannot explain the localization of fluorescence in particular structures on the animals. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluorescence might serve to attract prey. In laboratory experiments, the predator was the hydromedusa Olindias formosus ( previously known as O. formosa), which has fluorescent and pigmented patches on the tips of its tentacles. The prey, juvenile rockfishes in the genus Sebastes, were significantly more attracted (P<1?10-5 ) to the medusa's tentacles under lighting conditions where fluorescence was excited and tentacle tips were visible above the background. The fish did not respond significantly when treatments did not include fluorescent structures or took place under yellow or white lights, which did not generate fluorescence visible above the ambient light. Furthermore, underwater observations of the behavior of fishes when presented with a brightly illuminated point showed a strong attraction to this visual stimulus. In situ observations also provided evidence for fluorescent lures as supernormal stimuli in several other marine animals, including the siphonophore Rhizophysa eysenhardti. Our results support the idea that fluorescent structures can serve as prey attractants, thus providing a potential function for GFPs and other fluorescent proteins in a diverse range of organisms.  2015.

Sexual and Social Behavior of Crustacea,"The Crustacea represents one of the major branches in the tree of animal life, displaying diversity in form and lifestyle that rival those of the vertebrates and insects. But perhaps because of the primarily aquatic habits of crustaceans, they have received much less attention in evolutionary ecology than mostly terrestrial taxa. The chapters in this book make clear the richness of adaptations of crustaceans to social and sexual life, and their still largely untapped potential to test fundamental theory in behavioral ecology and evolution. Kinship, cooperation, and conflict play an important role in social evolution, modulated by extrinsic factors (resource competition, predation or parasitism), some of which have only recently begun to be studied. There are rich opportunities awaiting the student willing to pursue them, both in clarifying the social and sexual biology of individual crustacean species and in exploiting the Crustacea in broad comparative approaches to testing evolutionary theory.

Antibiotic resistance and protease production by Photorhabdus luminescens and Xenorhabdus poinarii bacteria symbiotic with entomopathogenic nematodes: Variation among species and strains,"Bacteria in the genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus are highly pathogenic to insects and are symbiotically associated with nematodes in the genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema, respectively. We compared extracellular protease production and resistance to antibiotics (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, neomycin and tetracycline) for 32 isolates of P. luminescens and 11 isolates of X. poinarii taken from nematodes isolated from soil in southern New Jersey. P. luminescens produced greater amounts of protease, and was more resistant to erythromycin and less resistant to neomycin than X. poinarii. No interspecific differences in resistance to chloramphenicol or tetracycline were detected. Variability within species was not related to the site, habitat or soil core from which the isolates were obtained, and was not associated with variation in the color of the host cadaver for P. luminescens. Resistance to erythromycin was positively correlated with resistance to both neomycin and tetracycline for P. luminescens, but was negatively correlated with resistance to neomycin for X. poinarii. Antibiotic resistance profiles and extracellular protease production might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably have ecological significance with respect to intra- and interspecific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control.",MA21,MW,exclude,,
Flexible cuckoo chick-rejection rules in the superb fairy-wren,"Recognition of brood parasitic cuckoo nestlings poses a challenge to hosts because cues expressed by cuckoos and host young may be very similar. In theory, hosts should use flexible recognition rules that maximize the likelihood of rejecting cuckoo nestlings while minimizing the risk of rejecting their own young. Our previous work revealed that female superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus often abandoned nestling cuckoos and that the presence of a single chick in the nest was 1 trigger for abandonment because fairy-wrens also sometimes abandoned a single fairy-wren chick. Here we use a combination of 20 years of observational data, a cross-fostering experiment, and a brood size reduction experiment to determine the basis for individual variability in the chick-rejection rules of superb fairy-wrens in response to parasitism by Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos Chalcites basalis. We show that the decision to abandon a single chick is based on integration of learned recognition cues and external cues. Experienced females were relatively more likely to abandon a single cuckoo chick and accept a single fairy-wren chick than naive females. Breeding experience therefore facilitates the ability to make an accurate rejection decision, perhaps through learned refinement of the recognition template. In addition, fairy-wrens modified their rejection threshold in relation to the presence of adult cuckoos in the population, becoming more likely to abandon single nestlings with increasing risk of parasitism. By using these flexible rejection rules, female superb fairy-wrens are more likely to defend themselves successfully against exploitation by the cuckoo and are less prone to mistakenly reject their own offspring.",MA150,MW,exclude,,
The behavioural ecology of personality: consistent individual differences from an adaptive perspective,"Individual humans, and members of diverse other species, show consistent differences in aggressiveness, shyness, sociability and activity. Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such `personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.",MA363,MW,include,intraspecific,"review, modeling"
Fitness consequences of pheromone production and host selection strategies in a tree-killing bark beetle (Coleoptera : Curculionidae : Scolytinae),"Timing of arrival at a resource often determines an individual's reproductive success. Tree-killing bark beetles can reproduce in healthy trees by attacking in adequate numbers to overcome host defences that could otherwise be lethal. This process is mediated by aggregation and antiaggregation pheromones. Beetles that arrive early in such a ``mass attack{''} must contend with undiminished tree defences, and produce enough pheromones to attract more beetles, but have a head start on gallery construction and egg-laying. Beetles that arrive late may be impeded by competition and diminishing availability of phloem, but should experience fewer costs associated with pheromone production and battling tree defences. We investigated relationships between timing of arrival, body size, pheromone production and fitness in the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis. In field experiments, we captured beetles that arrived early (pioneers) and late on slash pine trees, Pinus elliottii, and measured pheromone amounts in their hindguts. We marked gallery entrances of beetles as they landed on a tree and measured their reproductive success after the attack terminated. We found no difference in body size or pheromone amounts between early and late arrivers. Most beetles arrived at the middle of the attack sequence, and excavated longer galleries per day than early arrivers. The number of offspring produced per day by beetles that established galleries midway through mass attack was higher than those that arrived early or very late in the sequence. Our results suggest that beetles do not exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in pre-landing pheromone production, depending on the extent of previous colonisation of a host. Rather, it appears that stabilising selection favours beetles that attack in the middle of the sequence, and contributes to attack synchrony. Synchronous attack on trees is essential before population booms characteristic of tree-killing bark beetles can occur in nature.",MA148,MW,exclude,,
Transgenerational wing induction upon fungal infection of aphids,"Aphids, like most animals, mount a diverse set of defenses against pathogens. For aphids, two of the best studied defenses are symbiont-conferred protection and transgenerational wing induction. Aphids can harbor bacterial symbionts that provide protection against pathogens, parasitoids and predators, as well as against other environmental stressors. In response to signals of danger, aphids also protect not themselves but their offspring by producing more winged than unwinged offspring as a way to ensure that their progeny may be able to escape deteriorating conditions. Such transgenerational wing induction has been studied most commonly as a response to overcrowding of host plants and presence of predators, but recent evidence suggests that pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) may also begin to produce a greater proportion of winged offspring when infected with fungal pathogens. Here, we explore this phenomenon further by asking how protective symbionts, pathogen dosage and environmental conditions influence this response. Overall, while we find some evidence that protective symbionts can modulate transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal pathogens, we observe that transgenerational wing induction in response to fungal infection is highly variable. That variability cannot be explained entirely by symbiont association, by pathogen load or by environmental stress, leaving the possibility that a complex interplay of genotypic and environmental factors may together influence this trait.  2018 MDPI AG.

Evolutionary maintenance of genomic diversity within arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,"Most organisms are built from a single genome. In striking contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi appear to maintain genomic variation within an individual fungal network. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dwell in the soil, form mutualistic networks with plants, and bear multiple, potentially genetically diverse nuclei within a network. We explore, from a theoretical perspective, why such genetic diversity might be maintained within individuals. We consider selection acting within and between individual fungal networks. We show that genetic diversity could provide a benefit at the level of the individual, by improving growth in variable environments, and that this can stabilize genetic diversity even in the presence of nuclear conflict. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi complicate our understanding of organismality, but our findings offer a way of understanding such biological anomalies.",MA133,MW,exclude,,
Plant-animal interactions in suburban environments: Implications for floral evolution,"Plant interactions with mutualists and antagonists vary remarkably across space, and have played key roles in the ecology and evolution of flowering plants. One dominant form of spatial variation is human modification of the landscape, including urbanization and suburbanization. Our goal was to assess how suburbanization affected plant-animal interactions in Gelsemium sempervirens in the southeastern United States, including interactions with mutualists (pollination) and antagonists (nectar robbing and florivory). Based on differences in plant-animal interactions measured in multiple replicate sites, we then developed predictions for how these differences would affect patterns of natural selection, and we explored the patterns using measurements of floral and defensive traits in the field and in a common garden. We found that Gelsemium growing in suburban sites experienced more robbing and florivory as well as more heterospecific but not conspecific pollen transfer. Floral traits, particularly corolla length and width, influenced the susceptibility of plants to particular interactors. Observational data of floral traits measured in the field and in a common garden provided some supporting but also some conflicting evidence for the hypothesis that floral traits evolved in response to differences in species interactions in suburban vs. wild sites. However, the degree to which plants can respond to any one interactor may be constrained by correlations among floral morphological traits. Taken together, consideration of the broader geographic context in which organisms interact, in both suburban and wild areas, is fundamental to our understanding of the forces that shape contemporary plant-animal interactions and selection pressures in native species.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",MA283,MW,exclude,,
Alternative reproductive tactics in male Cape ground squirrels Xerus inauris,"In some animal societies, males vary in the strategies and tactics that they use for reproduction. Explanations for the evolution of alternative tactics have usually focussed on extrinsic factors such as social status, the environment or population density and have rarely examined proximate differences between individuals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that two alternative reproductive tactics occur in cooperatively breeding male Cape ground squirrels. Here we show that there is strong empirical support for physiological and behavioural differences to uphold this claim. `Dispersed' males have higher resting metabolic rates and a heightened pituitary activity, compared with philopatric `natal' males that have higher circulating cortisol levels. Dispersed males also spend more time moving and less time feeding than natal males. Additionally, lone males spend a greater proportion of their time vigilant and less of their time foraging than those that were in groups. The choice of whether to stay natal or become a disperser may depend on a number of factors such as age, natal group kin structure and reproductive suppression, and the likelihood of successful reproduction whilst remaining natal. Measuring proximate factors, such as behavioural and endocrine function, may provide valuable insights into mechanisms that underlie the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics.

Chytrid epidemics may increase genetic diversity of a diatom spring-bloom,"Contrary to expectation, populations of clonal organisms are often genetically highly diverse. In phytoplankton, this diversity is maintained throughout periods of high population growth (that is, blooms), even though competitive exclusion among genotypes should hypothetically lead to the dominance of a few superior genotypes. Genotype-specific parasitism may be one mechanism that helps maintain such high-genotypic diversity of clonal organisms. Here, we present a comparison of population genetic similarity by estimating the beta-dispersion among genotypes of early and peak bloom populations of the diatom Asterionella formosa for three spring-blooms under high or low parasite pressure. The Asterionella population showed greater beta-dispersion at peak bloom than early bloom in the 2 years with high parasite pressure, whereas the within group dispersion did not change under low parasite pressure.

Complement of integrated fertilizer management and integrated pest management concepts to ameliorate faba bean growth and yield [Ergnzung des integrierten dngungs und krankheitsmanagements zur verbesserung des wachstums und ertrags von ackerbohnen],"Twenty-one microbial preparations recommended for controlling pathogenic fungal strains causing root rot and wilt diseases of faba bean were investigated for antibiosis against several symbiotic and associative diazotrophs adopting a modified agar-plate-inhibition-zone assay. Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium exhibited a somewhat similar susceptibility to biocontrol agents while associative diazotrophs showed variable responses. Azotobacter, compared to others, was severely inhibited by such bio-candidates. The members of the biofertilizer formulation Biofertan did bear mixed cultivation with the majority of biocontrol agents. Among those, Bacillus subtilis was deemed the pioneer. In pot experiments, almost all the antagonists significantly restricted the severity of root rot and wilt diseases besides modifying faba bean seedling stand and improving plant development. This was very obvious with shoot biomass increases of >50%. Moreover, the bioagents successfully recovered the legume establishment, seriously injured due to pathogenic fungal infection. Simultaneous inoculation with Rhizobium and biocontrol agents provided more growth stimulation compared to either when introduced individually. Field-grown faba beans were inoculated with the diazotroph and representatives of biocontrol strains by two different methods, seed coating and over-head soil. Growth parameters determined were the highest when the legume plant was seed-coated by Rhizobium simultaneously over-head soil inoculated with the bacterial bioagents; this was reported with Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aerugenosa. The significance of combined application of biofertilizer and bioagent to ensure cheap, clean and safe farm products is discussed.  2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",MA65,MW,exclude,,
Ecological effects on gut bacterial communities in wild bumblebee colonies,"1.Animal hosts harbour diverse and often specific bacterial communities (microbiota) in their gut. These microbiota can provide crucial services to the host such as aiding in digestion of food and immune defence. However, the ecological factors correlating with and eventually shaping these microbiota under natural conditions are poorly understood. 2.Bumblebees have recently been shown to possess simple and highly specific microbiota. We here examine the dynamics of these microbiota in field colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris over one season. The gut bacteria were assessed with culture-independent methods, that is, with terminal restriction fragment length profiles of the 16S rRNA gene. 3.To further understand the factors that affect the microbiota, we experimentally manipulated field-placed colonies in a fully factorial experiment by providing additional food or by priming the workers' immune system by injecting heat-killed bacteria. We furthermore looked at possible correlates of diversity and composition of the microbiota for (i) natural infections with the microbial parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi, (ii) bumblebee worker size, (iii) colony identity, and (iv) colony age. 4.We found an increase in diversity of the microbiota in individuals naturally infected with either C. bombi or N. bombi. Crithidia bombi infections, however, appear to be only indirectly linked with higher microbial diversity when comparing colonies. The treatments of priming the immune system with heat-killed bacteria and additional food supply, as well as host body size, had no effect on the diversity or composition of the microbiota. Host colony identity had only a weak effect on the composition of the microbiota at the level of resolution of our method. We found both significant increases and decreases in the relative abundance of selected bacterial taxa over the season. 5.We present the first study on the ecological dynamics of gut microbiota in bumblebees and identify parasite infections, colony identity and colony age as important factors influencing the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities. The absence of an effect of our otherwise effective experimental treatments suggests a remarkable ability of the host to maintain a homoeostasis in this community under widely different environments.  2012 British Ecological Society.",MA111,MW,exclude,,
Feedback between Population and Evolutionary Dynamics Determines the Fate of Social Microbial Populations,"The evolutionary spread of cheater strategies can destabilize populations engaging in social cooperative behaviors, thus demonstrating that evolutionary changes can have profound implications for population dynamics. At the same time, the relative fitness of cooperative traits often depends upon population density, thus leading to the potential for bi-directional coupling between population density and the evolution of a cooperative trait. Despite the potential importance of these eco-evolutionary feedback loops in social species, they have not yet been demonstrated experimentally and their ecological implications are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a strong feedback loop between population dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of a social microbial gene, SUC2, in laboratory yeast populations whose cooperative growth is mediated by the SUC2 gene. We directly visualize eco-evolutionary trajectories of hundreds of populations over 50-100 generations, allowing us to characterize the phase space describing the interplay of evolution and ecology in this system. Small populations collapse despite continual evolution towards increased cooperative allele frequencies; large populations with a sufficient number of cooperators ``spiral{''} to a stable state of coexistence between cooperator and cheater strategies. The presence of cheaters does not significantly affect the equilibrium population density, but it does reduce the resilience of the population as well as its ability to adapt to a rapidly deteriorating environment. Our results demonstrate the potential ecological importance of coupling between evolutionary dynamics and the population dynamics of cooperatively growing organisms, particularly in microbes. Our study suggests that this interaction may need to be considered in order to explain intraspecific variability in cooperative behaviors, and also that this feedback between evolution and ecology can critically affect the demographic fate of those species that rely on cooperation for their survival.",MA144,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
Selfish punishment: Altruism can be maintained by competition among cheaters,"Altruistic punishment refers to a class of behaviors that deters cheating at a cost to the punisher, making it a form of second-order altruism. Usually, it is assumed that the punishers are themselves ``solid citizens{''} who refrain from cheating. We show in a simulation model that altruism and punishment paradoxically become negatively correlated, leading to a form of selfish punishment. Examples of selfish punishment can be found in organisms as diverse as wasps, birds, and humans. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Parabiotic associations between tropical ants: Equal partnership or parasitic exploitation?,"1. The huge diversity of symbiotic associations among animals and/or plants comprises both mutualisms and parasitisms. Most symbioses between social insect species, however, involve social parasites, while mutual benefits have been only suspected for some parabiotic associations - two colonies that share a nest. 2. In the rainforest of Borneo, we studied parabiotic associations between the ants Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur. Parabiotic nests were regularly found inside hollow tree trunks, most likely initiated by Cr. modiglianii. This species frequently nested without its partner, whereas we never found non-parabiotic Ca. rufifemur nests. We experimentally investigated potential benefits, potential interference competition for food (as a probable cost), and foraging niches of both species. 3. The two species never showed aggressive interactions and amicably shared food resources. However, Cr. modiglianii had a wider temporal and spatial foraging range than Ca. rufifemur, always found baits before Ca. rufifemur and recruited more efficiently. Camponotus rufifemur probably benefited from following pheromone trails of Cr. modiglianii. In turn, Ca. rufifemur was significantly more successful in defending the nest against alien ants. Crematogaster modiglianii hence may profit from its partner's defensive abilities. 4. In neotropical parabioses, epiphytes grown in 'ant-gardens' play a crucial role in the association, e.g. by stabilization of nests. Hemiepiphytic Poikilospermum cordifolium (Cecropiaceae) seedlings and saplings frequently grew in the entrances of parabiotic nests in Borneo, obviously dispersed by the ants. In cafeteria experiments, both parabiotic ants carried its elaiosome-bearing seeds into the nest. However, P. cordifolium does not provide additional nest space, contrasting with neotropical ant-gardens. 5. The parabiotic association appears beneficial for both ant species, the main benefits being nest initiation by Cr. modiglianii and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur), and, in turn, nest defence by Ca. rufifemur (for Cr. modiglianii). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa.  2009 British Ecological Society.",MA267,MW,include,interspecific,competition/cooperation
Heterogenistics: An epistemological restructuring of biological and social sciences,"The epistemology which sees intra-specific and intra-group heterogenization, symbiotization, interactive pattern-generating and change as basic principles produces types of theories and research strategies different from the epistemology based on the notions of intra-specific and intra-group uniformity, competition and stabilization. In the uniformistic view, individual variations have been reduced mainly either to statistical deviations from the mean or to dominance relationship. On the other hand in the heterogenistic view, mutual beneficial interactions between qualitatively heterogeneous individuals within a group is regarded as indispensable for the increase of the level of behavioral and biological sophistication and evolution. This article compares five epistemologies including the two mentioned above in the context of the current epistemological transition in science, particularly due to the emergence of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in physics and differentiation-amplifying reciprocal causal models in mathematics and engineering, both of which consider the universe as pattern-generating, information-creating and evolving.  1977 Leiden University Press/Dr. W.

Symbiont dynamics and strain diversity in the defensive mutualism between Lagria beetles and Burkholderia,"Defensive mutualisms are often facultative in nature, and their evolutionary dynamics can be shaped by changes in local antagonist communities or arms races with coevolving antagonists. Under these conditions, selection may favour hosts that flexibly acquire symbionts producing compounds with bioactivity against current antagonists. Here, we study the prevalence, dynamics and strain diversity of Burkholderia gladioli bacteria in Lagria beetles, a recently described protective symbiosis involving vertical transmission and antifungal defense for the host eggs. In Lagria hirta, we investigate the fate of the bacteria during the host life cycle. Despite a transmission route relying solely on the females, the bacteria are present in both sexes during the larval stage, suggesting a potentially multifaceted defensive role. In L. hirta and L. villosa adults, culture-dependent and -independent techniques revealed that individual beetles harbour diverse Burkholderia strains from at least two different phylogenetic clades, yet all closely related to free-living B. gladioli. Interestingly, rearing the beetles in the laboratory strongly impacted symbiont strain profiles in both beetle species. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of the B. gladioli-Lagria symbiosis and present this as a valuable system for studying multiple strain coinfections, as well as the evolutionary and ecological factors regulating defensive symbiosis.  2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",MA357,MW,exclude,,
Effects of social immunity and unicoloniality on host-parasite interactions in invasive insect societies,"Social insects have a very high potential to become invasive pest species. Here, we explore how their social lifestyle and their interaction with parasites may contribute to this invasive success. Similar to solitary species, parasite release followed by the evolution of increased competitive ability can promote establishment of introduced social insect hosts in their introduced range. Genetic bottlenecks during introduction of low numbers of founder individuals decrease the genetic diversity at three levels: the population, the colony and the individual, with the colony level being specific to social insects. Reduced genetic diversity can affect both the individual immune system and the collective colony-level disease defences (social immunity). Still, the dual immune system is likely to make social insects more robust to parasite attack. Changes in social structure from small, family-based, territorially aggressive societies in native populations towards huge networks of cooperating nests (unicoloniality) occur in some invasive social insects, for example, most invasive ants and some termites. Unicoloniality is likely to affect disease dynamics in multiple ways. The free exchange of individuals within the population leads to an increased genetic heterogeneity among individuals of a single nest, thereby decreasing disease transmission. However, the multitude of reproductively active queens per colony buffers the effect of individual diseased queens and their offspring, which may result in a higher level of vertical disease transmission in unicolonial societies. Lastly, unicoloniality provides a competitive advantage over native species, allowing them to quickly become the dominant species in the habitat, which in turn selects for parasite adaptation to this common host genotype and thus eventually a high parasite pressure. Overall, invasions by insect societies are characterized by general features applying to all introduced species, as well as idiosyncrasies that emerge from their social lifestyle. It is important to study these effects in concert to be able to develop efficient management and biocontrol strategies.  2012 British Ecological Society.",MA115,MW,exclude,,
Aggressive responses to playback of solos and duets in a Neotropical antbird,"Duetting behaviour is a unique form of animal communication that occurs in many diverse taxa in the animal kingdom. Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner's songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of barred antshrikes, Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects' behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding.

Interindividual patterns of resource use in three subtropical Atlantic Forest frogs,"Studies with disparate taxa suggest that generalist populations are composed of relatively specialist individuals that use a narrow part of a population's resource pool. Models based on optimum diet theory (ODT) can be used to predict different patterns of variation in resource use among individuals. In this work, we investigated the diet and measured the degree of individual specialization of three anuran species, Hypsiboas leptolineatus, Pseudis cardosoi and Scinax granulatus, from the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. The study is based on gut content obtained using a stomach-flushing technique. Additionally, we tested for a correlation between the individuals' diet and morphological variation. Furthermore, we applied methods based on network theory to investigate patterns of resource use among individuals of each species. All three study species showed generalized diets and significant values of individual specialization. However, we did not find any correlation between diet and morphology, indicating that diet variation is not a consequence of morphological trade-offs. The individual-resource networks of H.leptolineatus and S.granulatus showed a nested pattern. This result indicates the presence of individuals with more diverse diets than others, and the diets of the more specialist individuals are a predictable subset of the diets of the more generalist ones. The individual-resource network of P.cardosoi did not show a distinct pattern, diverging from what was predicted by optimal diet theory-based models. Although nested or modular patterns are commonly found in individual-resource networks, our results indicate that they are not ubiquitous and that random patterns can also be found.",MA213,MW,exclude,,
"Factors Affecting Interspecific Aggression in a Year-Round Territorial Species, the Jewel Damselfish","Vertebrates live in complex species networks in which interspecific interactions are common. In some contexts, the aggressive behaviours shown in these interspecific interactions are very similar to those shown in intraspecific interactions. It is still an open question whether intra- and interspecific aggression share common causality. We studied a year-round territorial species the jewel damselfish, (Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus), which cultivate algae they feed on. Territory holders aggressively defend these algae that are an attractive resource for many other species. In this study, we recorded territorial aggression in free-living individuals and recorded aggressive responses to a standardized territorial intrusion test in captive individuals. Field observations indicated that territorial aggression was selectively targeted towards food competitors. Independent of the size of the species, aggression was more frequent towards common species around their territories. This relationship was confirmed experimentally by confronting the jewel damselfish with novel objects to which the subjects were exposed either frequently or rarely. We suggest that jewel damselfish have to learn which species are competitors and therefore should be chased. In a standardized intrusion test with captive individuals, no significant differences were found in territorial responses towards intra- or interspecific intruders. Neither territorial aggression nor the intrusion showed any relationship with plasma androgen levels. Together, these data suggest that experience might be more important in non-seasonal territorial aggression than circulating hormonal factors.",MA139,MW,exclude,,
Microbiology is the basis of sustainable agriculture: An opinion,"Agricultural microbiology is presented as a synthetic research field responsible for knowledge transfer from general microbiology and microbial ecology to the agricultural biotechnologies. The major goal of agricultural microbiology is a comprehensive analysis of symbiotic micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi) interacting with agriculturally important plants and animals: here we have focussed on plants. In plants, interactions with micro-organisms are diverse, ranging from two-partite symbioses (e.g. legume-rhizobia N 2-fixing nodular symbioses or arbuscular mycorrhiza) to multipartite endophytic and epiphytic (root-associated, phyllosphere) communities. Two-partite symbioses provide the clearest models for addressing genetic cooperation between partners, resulting in the formation of super-organism genetic systems, which are responsible for host productivity. Analysis of these systems has now been extended considerably by using the approaches of metagenomics, which allow the dissection of taxonomic/population structures and the metabolic/ecological functions of microbial communities, which have resulted from the adaptation of free-living, soil microflora in the endosymbiotic niches. Both beneficial (nutritional, defensive, regulatory) and antagonistic (biocontrol) functions expressed by symbiotic microbes towards their hosts are the potential subjects of effective agronomic use. A fundamental knowledge of the genetics, molecular biology, ecology and evolution of symbiotic interactions could enable the development of microbe-based sustainable agriculture. This could achieve: (a) an improvement of major adaptive functions and productivity in crop plants by manipulating their microbial cohabitants; (b) partial or even full substitution of ecologically hazardous agrochemicals (mineral fertilizers, pesticides) by microbial preparations; (c) a decrease in the cost and an improvement of the quality of agricultural products.  2011 Association of Applied Biologists.",MA243,MW,include,interspecific,"Host-symbiont, review"
Individual variation in resource use by opossums leading to nested fruit consumption,"Despite recent findings on the ecological relevance of within population diet variation far less attention has been devoted to the role diet variation for ecological services. Seed dispersal is a key ecological service, affecting plant fitness and regeneration based on foraging by fruit-eating vertebrates. Here we used a network approach, widely used to understand how seed-dispersal is organized at the species level, to gain insights into the patterns that emerge at the individual-level. We studied the individual fruit consumption behavior of a South American didelphid Didelphis albiventris, during the cool-dry and warm-wet seasons. In species-species networks the heterogeneity in specialization levels generates patterns such as nestedness and asymmetry. Because generalist populations may be comprised of specialized individuals, we hypo thesized that network structural properties, such as nestedness, should also emerge at the individual level. We detected variation in fruit consumption that was not related to resource availability, ontogenetic or sexual factors or sampling biases. Such variation resulted in the structural patterns often found in species-species seed-dispersal networks: low connectance, a high degree of nestedness and the absence of modules. Moreover structure varied between the warm-wet and cool-dry seasons, presumably as a consequence of seasonal fluctuation in fruit availability. Our findings suggest individuals may differ in selectivity causing asymmetries in seed dispersal efficiency within the population. In this sense the realized dispersal would differ from the expected dispersal estimated from their average dispersal potential. Additionally the results suggest possible frequency-dependent effects on seed dispersal that might affect individual plant performance and plant community composition.",MA202,MW,include,interspecific,seed dispersal/fruit consumption
Aphid-encoded variability in susceptibility to a parasitoid,"Background: Many animals exhibit variation in resistance to specific natural enemies. Such variation may be encoded in their genomes or derived from infection with protective symbionts. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, for example, exhibits tremendous variation in susceptibility to a common natural enemy, the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi. Pea aphids are often infected with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, which confers partial to complete resistance against this parasitoid depending on bacterial strain and associated bacteriophages. That previous studies found that pea aphids without H. defensa (or other symbionts) were generally susceptible to parasitism, together with observations of a limited encapsulation response, suggested that pea aphids largely rely on infection with H. defensa for protection against parasitoids. However, the limited number of uninfected clones previously examined, and our recent report of two symbiont-free resistant clones, led us to explicitly examine aphid-encoded variability in resistance to parasitoids. Results: After rigorous screening for known and unknown symbionts, and microsatellite genotyping to confirm clonal identity, we conducted parasitism assays using fifteen clonal pea aphid lines. We recovered significant variability in aphid-encoded resistance, with variation levels comparable to that contributed by H. defensa. Because resistance can be costly, we also measured aphid longevity and cumulative fecundity of the most and least resistant aphid lines under permissive conditions, but found no trade-offs between higher resistance and these fitness parameters. Conclusions: These results indicate that pea aphid resistance to A. ervi is more complex than previously appreciated, and that aphids employ multiple tactics to aid in their defense. While we did not detect a tradeoff, these may become apparent under stressful conditions or when resistant and susceptible aphids are in direct competition. Understanding sources and amounts of variation in resistance to natural enemies is necessary to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic interactions, such as the potential for coevolution, but also for the successful management of pest populations through biological control.  2014 Martinez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA22,MW,exclude,,
"Mutualism, market effects and partner control","Intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism often feature a marked asymmetry in the scope for exploitation. Cooperation may nevertheless persist despite one-sided opportunities for cheating, provided that the partner vulnerable to exploitation has sufficient control over the duration of interaction. The effectiveness of the threat of terminating an encounter, however, depends upon the ease with which both the potential victim and the potential exploiter can find replacement partners. Here, we extend a simple, game-theoretical model of this form of partner control to incorporate variation in the relative abundance of potential victims and exploiters, which leads to variation in the time required for individuals of each type to find a new partner. We show that such market effects have a dramatic influence on the stable level of exploitation (and consequent duration of interaction). As the relative abundance of victims decreases, they become less tolerant to exploitation, terminating encounters earlier (for a given level of exploitation), whereas exploiters behave in a more cooperative manner. As a result, the stable duration of interaction actually increases, despite the decreasing tolerance of the victims. Below a critical level of relative victim abundance, the model suggests that the cost of finding a replacement partner becomes so great that it does not pay to exploit at all.",MA252,MW,include,intraspecific,"cooperation/conflict, modeling"
Non-immunological defense in an evolutionary framework,"After parasite infection, invertebrates activate immune system-based defenses such as encapsulation and the signaling pathways of the innate immune system. However, hosts are often able to defend against parasites without using these mechanisms. The non-immunological defenses, such as behaviors that prevent or combat infection, symbiont-mediated defense, and fecundity compensation, are often ignored but can be important in host parasite dynamics. We review recent studies showing that heritable variation in these traits exists among individuals, and that they are costly to activate and maintain. We also discuss findings from genome annotation and expression studies to show how immune system-based and non-immunological defenses interact. Placing these studies into an evolutionary framework emphasizes their importance for future studies of host parasite coevolution.",MA259,MW,exclude,,
Trends in variances and heritabilities with stand development of tropical pines,"Phenotypic and additive genetic variances as well as narrow-sense heritability for cumulative height were determined from assessments of tropical pine (Pinus caribaea Morelet, Pinus chiapensis (Mart.) Andresen, and Pinus tecunumanii (Schw.) Eguiluz et Perry) trials established in South America and South Africa by the Central America and Mexico Coniferous Resources (CAMCORE) Cooperative. Cumulative stem height was analyzed from 1- , 3-, 5-, and 8-year data collected on open-pollinated families to determine additive genetic and phenotypic variances. Variances based on arithmetic as well as log-transformed values are presented. Phenotypic and genetic variances of log-transformed values decreased over time, probably reflecting the onset of intergenotypic competition. Absolute variances increased over time as the trials became older, but the rate of increase for phenotypic variance was greater than that for additive variance. Individual narrow- sense heritabilities changed over time but without showing any definite trend by species. It appeared that variance trends reflected the varying ontogenetic changes during the development of the stands, which could be indicated by size of the trees rather than by their age. Breeding strategies in tropical pines should consider the increasing intensity of environmental effects as a stand matures, since they cause a decline of genetic variances at a higher rate than phenotypic variances. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that a phenotypic trait at a given ontogenetic stage of the individual is under temporal control of a set of genes that changes as the temporal environmental conditions change.",MA397,MW,exclude,,
State-dependent sentinels: an experimental study in the Arabian babbler,"Natural patterns of cooperative sentinel behaviour in Arabian babblers. Turdoides squamiceps have proven consistent with state-dependent models of individually selfish anti-predator strategies. Here we demonstrate experimentally that sentinel effort within groups is determined simply hy individual state. The two highest-ranking males in eight groups were separately fed a supplement of mealworms each for one day at a time. Control days before and after each treatment confirmed that Ilo carry-over effects occurred, and that most normal sentinel activity was carried our by alpha males, then beta males and then by. the rest of the group. When supplemented. both alpha and beta males exhibited similar marked increases in sentinel activity relative to control days. Unsupplemented males and the rest of the group incompletely compensated for these increases with reductions in sentinel effort. Differences in individual bod! mass within groups reflected natural and experimental variation in sentinel effort. Alpha and beta males weighed more than other group members, and gained mass only when supplementally fed. There was no evidence either for competitive sentinel behaviour, nor for an); increased interference between malts during the supplementation treatments. These results therefore provide strong evidence in support of the state-dependent approach to cooperative sentinel behaviour.",MA352,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation
Agrobiodiversity,"Agrobiodiversity refers to the variety and variability of living organisms that contribute to food and agriculture in the broadest sense, and that are associated with cultivating crops and rearing animals within ecological complexes. It is further expanded in some contexts to include all the organisms present in an agricultural landscape. Examples consist of crops and animal breeds, their wild relatives, and the species that interact with and support these species, for example, pollinators, symbionts, pests, parasites, predators, decomposers, and competitors. Croplands and fields as well as habitats and species outside of farming systems that affect agriculture and ecosystem functions in agricultural landscape are included. Agrobiodiversity can also refer to the extraction and utilization of products from natural ecosystems such as nonforest timber products, or livestock that pasture in grasslands. Utilization and conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is strongly influenced by socioeconomic factors at local, regional, and global scales. The concepts of agrobiodiversity are also valid for forestry and fisheries, especially in situations where human activities dominate the ecosystem processes.  2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Traps of carnivorous pitcher plants as a habitat: Composition of the fluid, biodiversity and mutualistic activities"," Background: Carnivorous pitcher plants (CPPs) use cone-shaped leaves to trap animals for nutrient supply but are not able to kill all intruders of their traps. Numerous species, ranging from bacteria to vertrebrates, survive and propagate in the otherwise deadly traps. This paper reviews the literature on phytotelmata of CPPs.  Pitcher Fluid as a Habitat: The volumes of pitchers range from 02 mL to 15 L. In Nepenthes and Cephalotus, the fluid is secreted by the trap; the other genera collect rain water. The fluid is usually acidic, rich in O2 and contains digestive enzymes. In some taxa, toxins or detergents are found, or the fluid is extremely viscous. In Heliamphora or Sarracenia, the fluid differs little from pure water.  Inquiline Diversity: Pitcher inquilines comprise bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi, rotifers, crustaceans, arachnids, insects and amphibia. The dominant groups are protists and Dipteran larvae. The various species of CPPs host different sets of inquilines. Sarracenia purpurea hosts up to 165 species of inquilines, followed by Nepenthes ampullaria with 59 species, compared with only three species from Brocchinia reducta. Reasons for these differences include size, the life span of the pitcher as well as its fluid.  Mutualistic Activities: Inquilines closely interact with their host. Some live as parasites, but the vast majority are mutualists. Beneficial activities include secretion of enzymes, feeding on the plants prey and successive excretion of inorganic nutrients, mechanical break up of the prey, removal of excessive prey and assimilation of atmospheric N2.  Conclusions: There is strong evidence that CPPs influence their phytotelm. Two strategies can be distinguished: (1) Nepenthes and Cephalotus produce acidic, toxic or digestive fluids and host a limited diversity of inquilines. (2) Genera without efficient enzymes such as Sarracenia or Heliamphora host diverse organisms and depend to a large extent on their symbionts for prey utilization.  The Author 2010.

"Hot spots, cold spots, and the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution","Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations ({''}hot spots{''}) but not in others ({''}cold spots{''}). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.",MA186,MW,exclude,,
Reproductive control via eviction (but not the threat of eviction) in banded mongooses,"Considerable research has focused on understanding variation in reproductive skew in cooperative animal societies, but the pace of theoretical development has far outstripped empirical testing of the models. One major class of model suggests that dominant individuals can use the threat of eviction to deter subordinate reproduction (the `restraint' model), but this idea remains untested. Here, we use long-term behavioural and genetic data to test the assumptions of the restraint model in banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), a species in which subordinates breed regularly and evictions are common. We found that dominant females suffer reproductive costs when subordinates breed, and respond to these costs by evicting breeding subordinates from the group en masse, in agreement with the assumptions of the model. We found no evidence, however, that subordinate females exercise reproductive restraint to avoid being evicted in the first place. This means that the pattern of reproduction is not the result of a reproductive `transaction' to avert the threat of eviction. We present a simple game theoretical analysis that suggests that eviction threats may often be ineffective to induce pre-emptive restraint among multiple subordinates and predicts that threats of eviction (or departure) will be much more effective in dyadic relationships and linear hierarchies. Transactional models may be more applicable to these systems. Greater focus on testing the assumptions rather than predictions of skew models can lead to a better understanding of how animals control each other's reproduction, and the extent to which behaviour is shaped by overt acts versus hidden threats.",MA305,MW,exclude,,
Leaf domatia and mites on Australasian plants: ecological and evolutionary implications,"Leaf domatia, specialized chambers in the vein axils on the underside of leaves of many plant species, have remained an enigma for over a century. In this study we show a strong association between foliar domatia and mites in 37 plant species in Australasia. Overall, mites accounted for 91% of the arthropods observed in domatia. Across all species, a median of 51% of domatia were occupied and 71% of leaves showed mite evidence in domatia. The level of mite association did not depend on domatia type (pit, pouch, pocket, or tuft) or provenance (Papua New Guinea, Queensland, Victoria, or New Zealand). Mite association with domatia commonly varied between plant species, between individuals within species, and between shoots within individuals. The leaf developmental stage probably explains much of the variation in association for many of these species. The presence of a variety of life history stages of mites within domatia indicates that these structures act as shelters for development and reproduction. Furthermore, in 12 of 13 plant species examined, domatia concentrate mites in particular locations on the leaf. Mite taxa that we classify as largely predaceous (e.g. phytoseiids, stigmaeids and tydeids) or fungivorous (e.g. acarids and oribatids) were most common in domatia and dominated the association in 21 of 24 plant species in which the relative abundance of herbivorous, fungivorous and predaceous groups was quantified. We evaluate hypotheses that explain the role of leaf domatia, including nonfunctional hypotheses (e.g. architectural constraints), physiological function (e.g. gas exchange and water uptake), bacterial symbiosis and antagonistic and mutualistic associations with mites. Our quantitative results confirm anecdotal accounts of mite association with leaf domatia and are most consistent with Lundstrem's centuryold hypothesis of plantmite mutualism in which leaf domatia billet predaceous and fungivorous mites that prey on plant enemies. Leaf domatia are widespread among woody angiosperms and abundant in many temperate and tropical regions of Australasia. Mites, an ancient group of arthropods whose diversity and abundance parallels that of insects, are likely to be important selective agents on terrestrial plants. Our results (1) indicate that mitedomatia association represents a relationship of comparable scope to plantant associations mediated by specialized plant structures such as extrafloral nectaries, food bodies and specialized domatia; (2) suggest that sociality is not a necessary prerequisite for widespread and diverse mutualisms between arthropods and plants; and, (3) extend the diversity of organisms that produce specialized mite houses from lizards, and wasps and bees to woody angiosperms. 1989 The Linnean Society",MA230,MW,exclude,,
Stable social relationships between unrelated females increase individual fitness in a cooperative bird,"Social animals often form long-lasting relationships with fellow group members, usually with close kin. In primates, strong social bonds have been associated with increased longevity, offspring survival and reproductive success. However, little is known about the fitness effects of social bonds between non-kin, especially outside of mammals. In this study, we use long-term field research on a cooperatively breeding bird, the greater ani (Crotophaga major), to ask whether adult females benefit by remaining in long-term associations with unrelated, co-breeding females. We find that females that have previously nested together synchronize their reproduction more rapidly than those nesting with unfamiliar partners, which leads to lower competition and higher fledging success. Importantly, although previous experience with a co-breeding female influenced reproductive synchrony, the degree of reproductive synchrony did not influence whether co-breeding females remained together in subsequent years, ruling out the alternate hypothesis that highly synchronized females are simply more likely to remain together. These results indicate that switching groups is costly to females, and that social familiarity improves reproductive coordination. Stable social relationships therefore have significant fitness consequences for cooperatively nesting female birds, suggesting that direct benefits alone may favour the evolution of associations between non-relatives and contribute to long-term group stability.  2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Direct and indirect effects of pollinators and seed predators to selection on plant and floral traits,"Although flowering traits are often assumed to be under strong selection by pollinators, significant variation in such traits remains the norm for most plant species. Thus, it is likely that the interactions among plants, mutualists, and other selective agents, such as antagonists, ultimately shape the evolution of floral and flowering traits. We examined the importance of pollination vs pre-dispersal seed predation to selection on plant and floral characters via female plant-reproductive success in Castilleja linariaefolia (Scrophulariaceae). C. linariaefolia is pollinated by hummingbirds and experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by plume moth and fly larvae in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, where this work was conducted. We first examined whether female reproduction in C. linariaefolia was limited by pollination. Supplemental pollination only marginally increased components of female reproduction, likely because seed predation masked, in part, the beneficial effects of pollen addition. In unmanipulated populations, we measured calyx length, flower production, and plant height and used path analysis combined with structural equation modeling to quantify their importance to relative seed set through pathways involving pollination vs seed predation. We found that the strength of selection on calyx length, flower production, and plant height was greater for seed predation pathways than for pollination pathways, and one character, calyx length, experienced opposing selection via pollination vs seed predation. These results suggest that the remarkable intraspecific variation in plant and floral characters exhibited by some flowering plants is likely the result of selection driven, at least in part, by pollinators in concert with antagonists, such as pre-dispersal seed predators.

Intraspecific variation in colony founding behavior and social organization in the honey ant Myrmecocystus mendax,"Persistent cooperation between unrelated reproductives occurs rarely in mature eusocial insect societies, and when present, is frequently geographically constrained. Here we present genetic and behavioral evidence showing that primary polygyny occurs in some, but not all populations of the honey ant Myrmecocystus mendax. Specifically, we found that all mature colonies sampled in a population in the Sierra Ancha Mountains of central Arizona (USA) were polygynous with a relatively high number of queens (average = 6.27), while the majority of mature colonies sampled in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona were monogynous. Field and laboratory observations showed that Chiricahua foundresses are primarily haplometrotic, whereas Sierra Ancha foundresses can be either haplometrotic or facultatively pleometrotic. Nestmate relatedness of mature Sierra Ancha field colonies suggests that the reproductive individuals within these colonies are unrelated, consistent with primary polygyny. In the laboratory, Sierra Ancha foundresses cooperatively established incipient colonies without queen reduction, and colonies with multiple queens produced more minims andworkers that may serve the role ofrepletes (honeypots) than haplometrotic colonies. This was in stark contrast to foundresses from the Chiricahua population, which showed strong aggression when forced to found colonies together in the laboratory. When brood raiding was experimentally induced between laboratory Sierra Ancha colonies, queens from colonies with more workers had a higher survival probability, although in some cases the competing colonies fused and queens from both colonies continued to reproduce. Fusion between incipient ant colonies is a rare phenomenon, but could contribute to the high frequency of polygyny and high queen number in mature colonies in the Sierra Ancha population.  2019, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",MA223,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
Lateralization in response to social stimuli in a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish,"Cerebral lateralization, an evolutionarily ancient and widespread phenomenon among vertebrates, is thought to bestow cognitive advantages. The advantages of lateralization at the individual-level do not necessarily require that the entire population share the same pattern of lateralization. In fact, directional bias in lateralization may lead to behavioural predictability and enhanced predator success or prey evasion. Recent theory has suggested that population-level lateralization may be favored if individuals are better able to perform coordinated behaviours, providing a distinct advantage in cooperative contexts. Here we test whether the highly social, cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher shows lateralized responses to a social stimulus. We found population-level biases in males; on average male N. pulcher use their right eye/left hemisphere to view their mirror image. Individual females had a preferred hemisphere, but these preferences appeared not to be directionally aligned among females. We discuss these results in the context of coordinated social behaviour and suggest future research directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",MA229,MW,exclude,,
Variance-sensitive green woodhoopoes: A new explanation for sex differences in foraging?,"Studies of cooperatively breeding birds rarely benefit from the extensive research on adaptive foraging behaviour, despite the potential for concepts such as state-dependent foraging to explain many aspects of behaviour in social groups. For example, sex differences in preferred foraging techniques used by green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, have previously been explained by sexual dimorphism in bill length and the benefits afforded by foraging specialization and niche differentiation within cooperative groups. Contrary to this argument, there were no sex differences in mean foraging success and/or prey size captured when males and females used the same foraging techniques. Subordinates of both sexes did experience lower and more varied foraging success compared with dominants, but probably only as a consequence of competition or inexperience. However, dominant males experienced greater variance in individual foraging success compared with dominant females, and dominant males also experienced greater variances in prey size when using their preferred foraging techniques. Dominant males therefore appeared to specialize in foraging techniques that provided more variable rewards, whilst dominant females consistently chose to minimize variation in reward. Dominant females also experienced less variance in foraging returns when using the same techniques as males, suggesting a possible link with sexual dimorphism in bill length. Partitioning of foraging niches in dominant green woodhoopoes therefore appears to be better explained by sex differences in variance (risk) sensitivity to foraging rewards. We suggest that this kind of detailed analysis of state-dependent foraging has the potential to explain many of the crucial age and sex differences in behaviour within cooperative groups.  2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",MA402,MW,exclude,,
"Competitive outcomes depend on host genotype, but not clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes, in Lolium perenne (Poaceae)","Premise of the study: Cool-season grasses infected by endophytic fungal symbionts sometimes show improved tolerance of herbivory and abiotic stresses, but the potential effects of endophytes on host competitive ability are unclear. This study examined intraspecific competition among variable genotypes of Lolium perenne with and without the endophyte Epichlo festucae var. lolii (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) to assess the effect of infection on competitive outcomes. Methods: Eleven host genotypes distributed among infected plants of four cultivars of L. perenne were used for two pairwise competition experiments. In the greenhouse, an infected or uninfected ramet of each genotype was grown alone and paired in competition with a ramet of an uninfected genotype of a native accession of L. perenne. Tiller numbers and root and shoot dry mass were determined for targets and competitor plants after 15 wk. Key results: Competition and host genotype had highly significant effects on all measured variables. However, endophyte-mediated effects on hosts were minor, and those that occurred depended on genotype. In addition, endophytic status of target plants did not influence tiller number or dry mass in 10 of 11 competitor genotypes, although these native genotypes did significantly vary in their competitive performance. Conclusions: Genotypic variation among cultivars and accessions from native populations of L. perenne determines the effect of both intraspecific competition and infection by a fungal endophyte. However, in the absence of herbivory, asexual clavicipi-taceous endophytes may not be as important to host success in competitive environments as previously thought in this globally important grass species.  2014 Botanical Society of America.",MA64,MW,exclude,,
Prey size and scramble vs. contest competition in a social spider: implications for population dynamics,"1. There are many benefits of group living, but also substantial costs, one of which is competition for resources. How scarce food resources are distributed among different members of a population or social group -whether via scramble or contest competition - can influence not only the variance in individual fitness, but also the stability and therefore survival of the group or population. 2. Attributes of the food resources themselves, such as their size, may influence the type of intraspecific competition that occurs and therefore the intrinsic stability of a group or population. 3. By experimentally manipulating the size of prey fed to artificial colonies of the social spider Anelosimus eximius, we investigated whether prey size could alter the degree of scramble vs. contest competition that takes place and, thus, potentially influence colony population dynamics. 4. We found that large prey were shared more evenly than small prey and that individuals in poor condition were more likely to feed when prey were large than when prey were small. Additionally, we show that individuals participating in prey capture are also more likely to feed on the captured prey. 5. We developed a simple mathematical model to explore the prey sizes that would be energetically worth defending, i.e. prey that are `economically defendable'. The model shows that neither very small prey, nor prey above a certain size is worth monopolizing, with only intermediate size prey being `economically defendable'. We therefore suggest the small and large prey in our experiment corresponds to our model's intermediate and large prey categories, respectively. 6. As the size of prey captured by social spider colonies increases with colony size, our findings suggest that scramble competition may predominate in large colonies. Scramble competition, combined with the fact that prey biomass per capita declines as colonies grow beyond a certain size, would then explain why extremely large colonies of this social spider may suddenly go extinct. Our project thus illustrates the potential triple link between characteristics of the resources, individual behaviour and population dynamics, a link rarely considered in an empirical setting.",MA293,MW,exclude,,
Bartonellosis: One health perspectives for an emerging infectious disease,"In recent years, an increasing number of Bartonella species have been identified as zoonotic pathogens, transmitted by animal bites, scratches, arthropods and even by needle sticks. Considering the diversity of newly discovered Bartonella species and subspecies and the large number and ecologically diverse animal reservoir hosts and the evolving spectrum of arthropod vectors that can transmit these bacteria among animals and humans, the clinical and diagnostic challenges posed by Bartonella transmission in nature are presumably much more complex than is currently appreciated by diagnosticians, vector biologists, ecologists, physicians, or veterinarians. Historically the term ""bartonellosis"" was attributed to infections with Bartonella bacilliformis, transmitted by sandflies in the Peruvian Andes. Currently, however, bartonellosis now includes infections caused by any Bartonella sp. anywhere in the world. Potentially, because Bartonella spp. can infect erythrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, CD34+ progenitor cells, and various macrophage-type cells, including microglial cells, dendritic cells, and circulating monocytes in vitro, the clinical and pathological manifestations of bartonellosis appear to be very diverse in both sick animals and human patients. Because 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, many of which are vector-transmitted by an arthropod, a One Health approach to bartonellosis and other zoonotic infections is needed to properly address animal health, public health, and environmental factors that influence the distribution and transmission of these bacteria. The One Health concept encourages a spirit of cooperation among animal, environmental, and human health professionals and promotes developing integrated solutions for complex problems that impact the health of animals, humans, and the planet. Importantly, substantial research is needed to define the medical importance of this genus as a cause of animal and human illnesses.  The Author 2014.

Spatial consequences for dolphins specialized in foraging with fishermen,"According to theory, individuals forage in ways that maximize net energy intake. Distinct foraging strategies may emerge within a population in response to heterogeneous resources, competition and learning, among other drivers. We assessed individual variation in, and ecological consequences of, an unusual, specialized foraging tactic between animals and humans. In southern Brazil, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, herd fish schools towards artisanal fishermen, who cast nets in response to behavioural cues from the dolphins. This apparent cooperative tactic likely involves costs as well as benefits for both interacting parties, but such trade-offs remain poorly understood, especially for dolphins. We show that individual dolphins vary markedly in the frequency with which they interact with fishermen, and that this foraging variation is linked to ranging behaviour. Not all individual dolphins interact with fishermen; those that routinely do so concentrate around the limited interaction sites and have smaller home ranges than independent foragers. This suggests that foraging with fishermen increases foraging success and reduces search costs (i.e. foraging range). Competition for interaction sites may offset such benefits, since some individuals often forage at the high-quality sites while others forage at low-quality sites. Taken together, our findings suggest that two alternative tactics emerge in the population from trade-offs involving food access, foraging area, learning techniques and competition: dolphins either forage by themselves over larger areas on unpredictable resource patches (passing fish schools), or learn to interact with fishermen to access and compete for more predictable resource patches (interaction sites). By revealing some of the ecological drivers of this remarkable human-animal interaction, our study contributes two broader insights. First, specialized foraging can have ranging consequences for individuals and so structure the population spatially; second, interspecific cooperation may be founded upon intraspecific competition.

Complex social behaviour can select for variability in visual features: a case study in Polistes wasps,"The ability to recognize individuals is common in animals; however, we know little about why the phenotypic variability necessary for individual recognition has evolved in some animals but not others. One possibility is that natural selection favours variability in some social contexts but not in others. Polistes fuscatus wasps have variable facial and abdominal markings used for individual recognition within their complex societies. Here, I explore whether social behaviour can select for variability by examining the relationship between social behaviour and variability in visual features (marking variability) across social wasp taxa. Analysis using a concentrated changes test demonstrates that marking variability is significantly associated with nesting strategy. Species with flexible nest-founding strategies have highly variable markings, whereas species without flexible nest-founding strategies have low marking variability. These results suggest that: (i) individual recognition may be widespread in the social wasps, and (ii) natural selection may play a role in the origin and maintenance of the variable distinctive markings. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that species with flexible nesting strategies have reproductive transactions, a type of complex social behaviour predicted to require individual recognition. Therefore, the reproductive transactions of flexible species may select for highly variable individuals who are easy to identify as individuals. Further, selection for distinctiveness may provide an alternative explanation for the evolution of phenotypic diversity.",MA68,MW,exclude,,
INTRACELLULAR SYMBIONTS AND THE EVOLUTION OF UNIPARENTAL CYTOPLASMIC INHERITANCE,"Uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic elements is widespread among eukaryotic organisms and is achieved by a diverse range of mechanisms. This paper shows that the cytoplasmic genetic system would be expected to evolve towards uniparental inheritance, given the existence of deleterious symbionts capable of invading the host cytoplasm together with nuclear genes that lead to the elimination of cytoplasmic elements from one of the gamete types. The reason for this is that, under biparental inheritance, foreign symbionts with strong deleterious effects are able to spread through host populations. A nuclear modifier gene which leads to the loss of cytoplasmic elements from one gamete type gains a net advantage as a symbiont spreads, because the modifier sometimes gives rise to a symbiont-free zygote. In so far as small gametes reduce the rate of symbiont transmission to the zygote, modifier genes causing small gamete size would tend to accumulate, so that cytoplasmic inheritance would become associated with maternal rather than paternal gametes. Once uniparental inheritance predominates in the host population, the population is protected from invasions by a large class of harmful symbionts, but at the same time those symbionts that benefit their hosts are still able to increase in frequency.",MA216,MW,exclude,,
Variation in individual investment strategies among social animals,"Cooperation and conflict are ubiquitous features of life in the vast majority of animals and can occur over a wide range of functional contents and at various levels. In this review I describe known and less well-known proximate aspects of cooperation and conflict over reproductive behaviour in social animals, where individuals other than the genetic parents contribute to the provisioning of care ('alloparental care'). Traditionally the evolution of alloparental care is viewed as a two-step process: the decision to delay dispersal and independent breeding, usually as a consequence of the existence of constraints on independent breeding, and the decision to behave as alloparents by which individuals that have delayed dispersal gain a net fitness benefit. Behavioural ecological theory generally assumes that all individuals are similar in 'make-up' and that life history and behavioural decisions are facultative. However, there is probably more individual variation in the amount and type of social behaviour than originally anticipated. Here, I demonstrate that some of these differences in behaviours are because of environmental factors, which may be associated with 'reaction norms' or the genotype's quantitative phenotypic variation, or which may yield polyethisms. Most evolutionary models of animal cooperation are based on optimality approaches that do not consider individual genetic variation and maternal effects on the variation in the expression of social behaviour. Further research on the genetic basis of cooperations and subordinate-breeder interactions may be crucial for understanding the evolution of social behaviour. If we take individual differences into account our conclusions and explanations of social behaviour may change. Given the conceptual similarities between the various research disciplines addressing different types of cooperation and conflict over investment, the issues described here should lead to more mutual attraction between the different disciplines and stimulate further development in our understanding of cooperation strategies in general.  2006 The Author.",MA405,MW,include,intraspecific,"cooperation, review"
"Bargaining power and adolescent aggression: the role of fighting ability, coalitional strength, and mate value","Basic models of animal conflict show that animals with more bargaining power can expect a larger share of resources and more frequently deploy aggression when challenged. Bargaining power comes from multiple sources including formidability (e.g. personal fighting ability) and cooperative value (e.g. mate value). Here, we apply this basic conceptual framework to human adolescents and test seven core hypotheses derived from this paradigm on a large sample of Swiss students (N = 1447; 15-17 years old). Three components of bargaining power were measured in males and females: fighting ability, coalitional strength, and mate value. Fighting ability and mate value reliably predicted aggression, aggressive attitudes, and delinquent behavior in both boys and girls. The effect of fighting ability on aggression was predictably larger and more robust in males than females. Coalitional strength also reliably predicted aggressive bargaining in boys but less consistently in girls. Regression analyses showed that the effect of each component of bargaining power was independent and survived numerous controls. Results support the thesis that individual differences in aggressive behavior result, in part, from individual differences in bargaining power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Of parasites and men,"The living world has evolved and is evolving through interspecific relationships between organisms. The diversity of these interactions is enormous going from mutualism to parasitism. Humans live with a multitude of microorganisms, essential for their biology. However, interactions are not always advantageous. Indeed, many organisms might become pathogens, such as the Plasmodium species, the causative agents of malaria. Like many other microorganisms, they are Machiavellian in their capacity to elaborate a range of reproduction strategies, giving them a huge advantage in terms of adaptation. Here, we discuss the role played by parasites in the ecology and evolution of living organisms and particularly of humans. In the study of infectious diseases, humans are legitimately the focal point, although they represent only one ecosystem among many others and not taking this into account certainly biases our global view of the system. Indeed, we know only a minimal fraction of the microorganisms we live with. However, parasites have shaped and are still shaping the human genome. Several genetic signatures are the proofs of the selection pressures by parasites that humankind has endured during its evolution.But, ultimately, what are the solutions. for living with pathogens?

Antagonistic interactions between honey bee bacterial symbionts and implications for disease,"Background: Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. One route by which honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae. Results: Here we isolate, culture, and describe by 16S rRNA and protein-coding gene sequences 61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly, symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this widespread pathogen. Conclusion: The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an important bee disease.  2006 Evans and Armstrong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",MA20,MW,exclude,,
Intraspecific variation in allelochemistry determines an invasive species' impact on soil microbial communities,"Invasive species can benefit from altered species interactions in their new range, and by interfering with species interactions among native competitors. Since exotic invasions are generally studied at the species level, relatively little is known about intraspecific variation in the traits that determine an invader's effect on native species. Alliaria petiolata is a widespread and aggressive invader of forest understories that succeeds in part by interfering with mutualistic interactions between native plants and soil fungi. Here, I show that the impact of A. petiolata on soil microbial communities varied among individuals due to variation in their allelochemical concentrations. The differential impacts translated into varied effects on native tree growth, partly because A. petiolata's allelochemicals preferentially affected the most mutualistic fungal taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering the spatial and temporal variation in an invasive species' impacts for understanding and managing the invasion process.",MA222,MW,include,interspecific,Variation in species A affecting mutualism between specie s B and C
Rapid evolution of symbiont-mediated resistance compromises biological control of aphids by parasitoids,"There is growing interest in biological control as a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to control pest insects. Aphids are among the most detrimental agricultural pests worldwide, and parasitoid wasps are frequently employed for their control. The use of asexual parasitoids may improve the effectiveness of biological control because only females kill hosts and because asexual populations have a higher growth rate than sexuals. However, asexuals may have a reduced capacity to track evolutionary change in their host populations. We used a factorial experiment to compare the ability of sexual and asexual populations of the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum to control caged populations of black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) of high and low clonal diversity. The aphids came from a natural population, and one-third of the aphid clones harbored Hamiltonella defensa, a heritable bacterial endosymbiont that increases resistance to parasitoids. We followed aphid and parasitoid population dynamics for 3months but found no evidence that the reproductive mode of parasitoids affected their effectiveness as biocontrol agents, independent of host clonal diversity. Parasitoids failed to control aphids in most cases, because their introduction resulted in strong selection for clones protected by H.defensa. The increasingly resistant aphid populations escaped control by parasitoids, and we even observed parasitoid extinctions in many cages. The rapid evolution of symbiont-conferred resistance in turn imposed selection on parasitoids. In cages where asexual parasitoids persisted until the end of the experiment, they became dominated by a single genotype able to overcome the protection provided by H.defensa. Thus, there was evidence for parasitoid counteradaptation, but it was generally too slow for parasitoids to regain control over aphid populations. It appears that when pest aphids possess defensive symbionts, the presence of parasitoid genotypes able to overcome symbiont-conferred resistance is more important for biocontrol success than their reproductive mode.  2017 The Authors.

"Cooperate or not cooperate EEG, autonomic, and behavioral correlates of ineffective joint strategies","Introduction: The neural activity in response to ineffective joint actions was explored in the present study. Subjects involved in a cooperative but frustrating task (poor performance as manipulated by an external feedback) were required to cooperate (T1) during an attentional task in a way to synchronize their responses and obtain better outcomes. Methods: We manipulated their strategies by providing false feedbacks (T2) signaling the incapacity to create a synergy, which was reinforced by a general negative evaluation halfway through the game. A control condition was provided (no cooperation required, T0) as well as a check for possible learning effect (time series analysis). The effects of the feedback in modulating subjects' behavioral performance and electrocortical activity were explored by means of brain oscillations (delta, theta, alpha, beta) and autonomic activity (heart rate, HR; skin conductance activity, SCR). Results: Results showed a specific pattern of behavioral, neural, and peripheral responses after the social feedback. In fact, within this condition, worse behavioral outcomes emerged, with longer response times with respect to the prefeedback one. In parallel, a specific right-lateralized effect was observed over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with increased delta and theta power compared to the previous condition. Moreover, increased SCR was observed with respect to the first part. Conclusions: Two interpretations are put forward to explain the present findings: 1) the contribution of negative emotions in response to failing interactions or 2) a motivational disengagement toward goal-oriented cooperation elicited by frustrating evaluations.",MA75,MW,exclude,,
Female home range size is regulated by resource distribution and intraspecific competition: a long-term field study,"The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

Variation and the response to variation as a basis for successful cooperation,"In applying game theory to problems in biology, differences between individuals are often ignored. In particular, when analysing the evolution of cooperation it is often implicitly assumed that ignoring variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate, differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change the nature of a game. Even small amounts ofvariability can stabilize cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters. Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction, leading to contingent behaviour that can reduce conflict, and to negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations, whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets, so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner, variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor the previous behaviour of others, and once this social sensitivity exists, the need to maintain a good reputation can promote cooperation.  2010 The Royal Society.",MA403,MW,include,intraspecific,cooperation/conflict
Intraspecific behavioral dynamics in a green turtle Chelonia mydas foraging aggregation,"We used animal-borne video footage to investigate the intraspecific behavioral dynamics of a green turtle Chelonia mydas foraging aggregation in Shark Bay, Western Australia, and test the hypothesis that the limited availability of a valuable habitat type promotes interference competition for access to these spaces. In 301 h of footage from 93 individuals, we recorded 176 turtle encounters involving between 1 and 7 turtles per encounter. The majority of encounters (55%) occurred in rare structurally complex benthic habitat (e.g. rock ledges) in deeper areas of this shallow sand-seagrass ecosystem, despite turtles spending only ca. 5% of their time at these sites. We recorded a suite of interactive behaviors nested within 3 encounter classes, which also showed habitat associations. Specifically, behaviorally diverse strongly interactive/social encounters, which represented 68% of total encounter time, occurred exclusively in structured areas. Turtle activities in these areas included solitary and group resting, self-cleaning (i.e. rubbing on hard surfaces), symbiotic cleaning by fish and other interactive behaviors including competitive contests. Competitive contests were 7 times more frequent in structured versus unstructured habitat, although turtle sightings were only twice as frequent in structured areas. In contrast, encounters in shallow habitat (e.g. seagrass beds) tended to be brief and involve limited interaction between solitary turtles. Interference competition at resting/refuge/cleaning sites could have a variety of important ecological implications, and a fuller understanding of chelonid sea turtle foraging ground behavioral ecology and habitat use (e.g. predictive habitat mapping) may require detailed knowledge of key non-foraging habitats.  2015 Inter-Research.",MA218,MW,exclude,,
Intraspecific variation in indirect plant-soil feedbacks influences a wetland plant invasion,"Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) influence plant competition via direct interactions with pathogens and mutualists or indirectly via apparent competition/mutualisms (i.e., spillover to co-occurring plants) and soil legacy effects. It is currently unknown how intraspecific variation in PSFs interacts with the environment (e.g., nutrient availability) to influence competition between native and invasive plants. We conducted a fully crossed multi-factor greenhouse experiment to determine the effects of Phragmites australis rhizosphere soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability on biomass of replicate populations from one native and two invasive lineages of common reed (P.australis) and a single lineage of native smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Harmful soil biota consistently dominated PSFs involving all three P.australis lineages, reducing biomass by 10\%. Indirect PSFs (i.e., soil biota spillover) from the two invasive P.australis lineages reduced S.alterniflora biomass by 7\%, whereas PSFs from the native P.australis lineage increased S.alterniflora biomass by 6\%. Interestingly, interspecific competition and PSFs interacted to weaken their respective impacts on S.alterniflora, whereas they exerted synergistic negative effects on P.australis. Phragmitesaustralis soil biota decreased S.alterniflora biomass when grown alone (i.e., a soil legacy), but increased S.alterniflora biomass when grown with P.australis, suggesting that P.australis recruits harmful generalist soil biota or facilitates S.alterniflora via spillover (i.e., apparent mutualism). Soil biota also reduced interspecific competition impacts on S.alterniflora, although it remained competitively inferior to P.australis across all treatments. Competitive interactions and responses to nutrients did not differ among P.australis lineages, indicating that interspecific competition and nutrient deposition may not be key drivers of P.australis invasion in North America. Although soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability appear to have no direct impact on the success of invasive P.australis lineages in North America, intraspecific lineage variation in indirect spillover and soil legacies from P.australis occur and may have important implications for co-occurring native species and restoration of invaded habitats. Our study integrates multiple factors linked to plant invasions, highlighting that indirect interactions are likely commonplace in influencing plant community dynamics and invasion success and impacts.",MA224,MW,include,interspecific,"competition, mutualism"
A General Scheme to Predict Partner Control Mechanisms in Pairwise Cooperative Interactions Between Unrelated Individuals,"Recent years have seen an explosion in the diversity of partner control mechanisms hypothesised to stabilise cooperative behaviour among unrelated individuals. Game theory suggests numerous strategies, each with specific decision rules that allow cooperators to control a non-contributing partner. This diversity of hypothetical strategies seems likely to reflect diversity in the types of intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism that exist in nature. It is therefore important to provide a framework that explains similarities and differences between the various hypothetical strategies and that predicts how key parameters that describe the natural history of natural systems favour different control mechanisms. We develop a novel unifying framework for pairwise interactions between unrelated individuals, in which we link specific control mechanisms to specific game structures. The latter are defined by unique combinations of the states of five parameters that describe investment, aspects of the payoff matrix, the number of interactions and partner choice. We find that specific control mechanisms potentially have utility in a limited number of game structures; conversely, each game structure may typically offer a few competing control mechanisms. Our framework offers theoreticians specific problems that await mathematical exploration, while at the same time offering empiricists guidelines for evaluating the game structure and corresponding control mechanisms in their systems.  2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",MA4,MW,exclude,,
Resource limitation moderates the adaptive suppression of subordinate breeding in a cooperatively breeding mongoose,"Social animal species show considerable variation in the way in which reproduction is distributed among group members. Recent attempts to explain this variation have proposed that differences in reproductive skew are attributable to differences in the net benefits group members receive from suppressing each other's breeding attempts. Despite receiving relatively little theoretical and empirical attention, the availability of resources required for successful breeding may have an important influence in determining the costs and benefits of suppressing reproduction and thus influence reproductive skew within social groups. Here, we test this possibility using a long-term study of female reproductive success in the banded mongoose Mungos mungo. We find that females experience greater costs of co-breeding when resources are in short supply and that older, more dominant females respond to this cost by suppressing subordinate breeding. This results in differing patterns of reproductive success for females of different competitive abilities, with the oldest, most dominant females breeding regardless of resource availability and younger, subordinate females breeding only when resources are abundant. Our findings highlight the role of resource limitation in determining the distribution of reproductive opportunities within social groups.  2012 The Author.",MA309,MW,exclude,,
"Slow algae, fast fungi: exceptionally high nucleotide substitution rate differences between lichenized fungi Omphalina and their symbiotic green algae Coccomyxa","Omphalina basidiolichens are obligate mutualistic associations of a fungus of the genus Omphalina (the exhabitant) and a unicellular green alga of the genus Coccomyxa (the inhabitant). It has been suggested that symbiotic inhabitants have a lower rate of genetic change compared to exhabitants because the latter are more exposed to abiotic environmental variation and competition from other organisms. In order to test this hypothesis we compared substitution rates in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) among fungal species with rates among their respective algal symbionts. To ensure valid comparisons, only taxon pairs (12) with a common evolutionary history were used. On average, substitution rates in the ITS1 portion of Omphalina pairs were 27.5 times higher than rates in the corresponding pairs of Coccomyxa since divergence from their respective ancestor at the base of the Omphalina/Coccomyxa lineage. Substitution rates in the 5.8S and the ITS2 portions were 2.4 and 18.0 times higher, respectively. The highest rate difference (43.0) was found in the ITS1 region. These are, to our knowledge, the highest differences of substitution rates reported for symbiotic organisms. We conclude that the Omphalina model system conforms to the proposed hypothesis of lower substitution rates in the inhabitant, but that the mode of transmission of the inhabitant (vertical versus horizontal) could be a prevailing factor in the regulation of unequal rates of nucleotide substitution between co-evolving symbionts. Our phylogenetic study of Coccomyxa revealed three main lineages within this genus, corresponding to free-living :Coccomyxa, individuals isolated from basidiolichens Omphalina and Coccomyxa isolated from ascolichens belonging to the Peltigerales.

Morphological identification and DNA barcoding of a new species of Parabrachiella (Siphonostomatoida: Lernaeopodidae) with aspects of their intraspecific variation,"We present a detailed morphological description and a DNA barcoding of Parabrachiella platensis n. sp. collected from Mugil liza Valenciennes in Samborombon Bay (Buenos Aires, Argentina). This new species was compared with two Parabrachiella species parasitic on mugilids: Parabrachiella exilis (Shiino, 1956) and Parabrachiella mugilis (Kabata, Raibaut et Ben Hassine, 1971). Parabrachiella platensis n. sp. differs from those species in the shape of posterior processes, the anal slit with two pairs of bipartite papillae, the size of cephalothorax, the trunk, the maxilla, the microhabitat on the host, and the lack of caudal rami. On the host, the new species was in the nostrils (a new site for a species of the genus Parabrachiella) and in the fins base. Some minor morphological differences were observed in relation to the locations on the host. The molecular analysis conducted based on mtDNA-COI between specimens of the new species on the fins and nostrils showed a genetic similarity of 99.8%. This percentage supports that the specimens found in nostrils and fins base could represent a single species. New studies on P. platensis n. sp., including infection of the same fish with the two forms, could bring some new information. Anyway according to the genetic information provided and the minimal morphological differences spotted we conclude that the two forms are a single specie. The differences observed are possibly influenced by the place of the host where the two forms of copepods were found, nostrils and fins. The new species was also molecularly compared to other five species of Parabrachiella including P. exilis (parasitizing mugilid from Chile), Parabrachiella anisotremis, Parabrachiella auriculata, Parabrachiella merluccii, and P. hugu (the last two sequences were taken from the GenBank). The genetic distance of 9% among P. platensis n. sp. and P. exilis, which is the close morphological related species, allow to states that these two copepods on mugilids belong to different species and then validating the morphological differences found between them.  2017 Elsevier B.V.",MA250,MW,exclude,,
Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History,"Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern, whereby the ecological relatedness of host-associated microbial communities parallels the phylogeny of related host species. Here, we test the prevalence of phylosymbiosis and its functional significance under highly controlled conditions by characterizing the microbiota of 24 animal species from four different groups (Peromyscus deer mice, Drosophila flies, mosquitoes, and Nasonia wasps), and we reevaluate the phylosymbiotic relationships of seven species of wild hominids. We demonstrate three key findings. First, intraspecific microbiota variation is consistently less than interspecific microbiota variation, and microbiota-based models predict host species origin with high accuracy across the dataset. Interestingly, the age of host clade divergence positively associates with the degree of microbial community distinguishability between species within the host clades, spanning recent host speciation events (~1 million y ago) to more distantly related host genera (~108 million y ago). Second, topological congruence analyses of each group's complete phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram reveal significant degrees of phylosymbiosis, irrespective of host clade age or taxonomy. Third, consistent with selection on hostmicrobiota interactions driving phylosymbiosis, there are survival and performance reductions when interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between closely related and divergent host species pairs. Overall, these findings indicate that the composition and functional effects of an animal's microbial community can be closely allied with host evolution, even across wide-ranging timescales and diverse animal systems reared under controlled conditions.  2016 Brooks et al.",MA278,MW,exclude,,
"On the Morphology of Balaenophilus manatorum (Ortiz, Lalana, and Torres) (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) from Sea Turtles of the Mexican Pacific with Notes on Intraspecific Variation","Specimens of the ectoparasitic harpacticoid Balaenophilus manatorum (Ortiz, Lalana, and Torres, 1992) (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) were collected recently from the skin of sea turtles nesting along the Pacific coast of central Mexico. Adult specimens were compared with descriptions of specimens collected around Japan and Cuba. The intra-Pacific and the northwestern Atlantic specimens differed in subtle character states of the antennule, antennal exopod, swimming legs 1-4, and female and male fifth legs. Differences were within the range of intraspecific variability, as inferred from (1) the level of morphological divergence of B. manatorum? from its only congener, Balaenophilus unisetus, also an epibiont of marine vertebrates.

Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning: A consensus of current knowledge,"Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.",MA113,MW,exclude,,
The fundamental role of competition in the ecology and evolution of mutualisms,"Mutualisms are interspecific interactions that yield reciprocal benefits. Here, by adopting a consumer-resource perspective, we show how considering competition is necessary in order to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of mutualism. We first review the ways in which competition shapes the ecology of mutualisms, using a graphical framework based on resource flows rather than net effects to highlight the opportunities for competition. We then describe the known mechanisms of competition and show how it is a critical driver of the evolutionary dynamics, persistence, and diversification of mutualism. We argue that empirical and theoretical research on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms will jointly progress by addressing four key points: (i) the existence and shape of physiological trade-offs among cooperation, competition, and other life-history and functional traits; (ii) the capacity for individuals to express conditional responses to variation in their mutualistic and competitive environment; (iii) the existence of heritable variation for mutualistic and competitive traits and their potentially conditional expression; and (iv) the structure of the network of consumer-resource interactions in which individuals are embedded.",MA377,MW,include,interspecific,"mutualism, review"
"Individual versus social complexity, with particular reference to ant colonies","Insect societies - colonies of ants, bees, wasps and termites vary enormously in their social complexity. Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategics and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species arc less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies arc characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.",MA203,MW,exclude,,
Determinants of reproductive success in dominant female meerkats,"1. In cooperative societies with high reproductive skew, selection on females is likely to operate principally through variation in the probability of acquiring dominant status and variation in reproductive success while dominant. Despite this, few studies of cooperative societies have investigated the factors that influence which females become dominant, and/or their reproductive output while in the dominant position. 2. Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6. These findings suggest that selection for body weight and competitive ability will be high in female meerkats, which may moderate their investment in cooperative activities. We suggest that similar consequences of competition may occur among females in other cooperative societies where the benefits of attaining dominance status are high.  2007 The Authors.",MA88,MW,exclude,,
Modelling the co-evolution of indirect genetic effects and inherited variability,"When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies, however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture. Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal individual and of the difference in trait value between the social partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection. Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases, i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller. Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.",MA245,MW,include,intraspecific,competition/cooperation
Impact of animal welfare on worldwide poultry production,"Animal welfare has become an important issue in poultry production. Concern about poultry welfare has mainly been expressed in industrialised countries. Since trade of poultry products is highly internationalised, welfare aspects have to be considered by all countries involved. This paper reviews the changes in the attitude to animal welfare in Western societies and the related development of regulations and standards, the impact of high welfare standards on production costs and on international trade of poultry products and finally, the influence of different stakeholders on poultry production and marketing. From the 1960s onwards, animal welfare activities have been focused on farm animals kept under 'industrial' conditions, such as caged laying hens. Consequently, the management conditions for laying hens in Europe have been regulated in detail by national laws and EU-Directives. Meanwhile, conventional cages have been banned in the EU and welfare activities are now directed towards other issues, such as beak-trimming and killing day-old chicks of layer lines. All measures which are considered to improve the welfare of animals increase cost of production. Hence, differences in national welfare regulations are expected to relocate poultry production to countries with low welfare standards. There is a tendency that important retailers and food chains use welfare as a marketing argument and establish high price premium labels. Standards which are established and controlled by stakeholders of the poultry market are independent of national welfare legislation. This will lead to harmonisation of welfare standards on an international level. Most welfare labels have been developed by retailers in cooperation with welfare-oriented NGOs. There is a new trend in Germany where retailers and farmers organisations develop welfare schemes and poultry producers are paid an extra allowance for welfare-friendly production. This system ensures that poultry farmers are reimbursed for the welfare-related costs.  Copyright 2018 World's Poultry Science Association.",MA191,MW,exclude,,
"Intraspecific host selection of Pre David's deer by cattle egrets in Dafeng, China","Studies have focused on foraging ecology of cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) and their selection of ungulate host species. However, few studies have been conducted at intraspecific levels, such as the sex/age class of a specific ungulate. In this study, the foraging behavior and intraspecific host selection of cattle egrets associated with Pre David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) were investigated at the Dafeng National Nature Reserve, China in summer 2011 and 2012. Egret-deer pairing status was analyzed and intraspecific host selection index was calculated. Cattle egrets preferred to feed with female deer compared with male deer and fawns. In contrast to solitary birds, cattle egrets following a deer benefited from a relatively low vigilance output, high foraging success, low energy expenditure, and high total foraging yields. These egrets also maximized benefits when they followed female deer compared with male deer and fawns. Our results further indicated that egrets likely preferred females because of the appropriate moving speed that allowed these egrets to follow and forage sufficiently and effectively. The males of Pre David's deer were possibly more aggressive than the females during the rutting season, causing egrets to experience difficulty in accompaniment and feeding. Fawns were not preferred because they were usually motionless and insufficiently large to stir more insects. We did not find any behavioral differences in vigilance and feeding between juveniles and adults. Our results suggested that cattle egrets could obtain significant benefits from their association with Pre David's deer, and these benefits were maximized when they followed female deer.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",MA221,MW,exclude,,
"Sociosexuality, testosterone, and life history status: prospective associations and longitudinal changes among men in Cebu, Philippines","Sociosexuality is defined as an individual's interest in uncommitted sexual activity and can be measured in terms of both psychological orientations and behavioral expression. In socio-ecological contexts in which adults monogamously partner and cooperate to raise children, individuals with unrestricted sociosexuality are likely to prioritize mating/competition over committed partnering and parenting. Given the importance of mother-father cooperation in the evolutionary past, humans may have the capacity to facultatively and opportunistically downregulate sociosexuality to focus on priorities related to invested partnering and parenting. To date, no prior studies have used longitudinal data to track within-individuals changes in sociosexuality as it relates to such life history transitions. Given the lack of prior longitudinal research in this area, it is likewise unknown what physiological mechanisms might mediate within-individual changes in sociosexuality through time but testosterone is a plausible candidate. To explore these questions, we drew on a large, long-running study of Filipino men (n = 288), who were single non-fathers at 25.9 years of age and were followed up 4-5 years later. We found that men with more unrestricted sociosexuality at baseline were more likely to experience relationship dissolution by follow-up, consistent with past work. Compared to men who remained single non-fathers at followup, men who became married residential fathers showed shifts towards more restricted global sociosexuality as well as sociosexual behavior. Relative to their own baseline values, married residential fathers also had more restricted sociosexuality in all domains at follow-up. They were the only group for whom this was found. We found theoretically-consistent but modest support for positive correlations between men's testosterone and their sociosexuality, but no evidence that the two change in tandem together through time. Our results suggest that some amount of between-individual differences in sociosexuality are not stable and can facultatively shift alongside other aspects of male reproductive effort.",MA339,MW,exclude,,
Culture and the evolution of social learning,"Applications of modern evolutionary theory to human culture have generated several different theoretical approaches that challenge traditional anthropological perspectives. `'Cultural selection'' and `'mind parasite'' theories model culture as an independent evolutionary system because transmission of cultural traits via social learning is distinct from transmission of genes via DNA replication, `'Dual-inheritance'' and `'co-evolution'' theories model culture as an intermediary evolutionary process that involves information from two inheritance systems: genetics and social learning, `'Evolutionary psychology'' theories emphasize that the evolutionary history of natural selection on mental processes links culture and biological adaptation; hence, cultural information is viewed as part of the organic phenotype and not an independent evolutionary system, Cross-cultural universals and scenarios of the `'environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' are used to identify characteristics of the `'evolved mind'' (human nature). `'Behavioral ecology'' theories examine relations between behavior and environmental context, Behavioral/cultural variations are viewed as products of flexible decision-making processes (evolved mind) that may respond adaptively to micro-environmental differences, It is difficult to devise empirical tests that distinguish among these theories, because they share many basic premises and make similar predictions about human behavior. Indeed, some of the apparent differences may be more semantic than substantive. Social learning is the key process underlying these evolutionary paradigms, Here I argue that human learning mechanisms are products of natural selection, and hence process information in ways that reflect evolutionary design, I review common objections to this hypothesis, including (1) learning processes are uncoupled from genetics and biological adaptation; (2) culture (or its effects) is partly extrasomatic; (3) culture, by most definitions, involves mental phenomena, including conscious thought; (4) culture involves the use of arbitrary symbols to communicate information; (5) culture appears to have emergent properties at the group level, such as shared values and beliefs resulting in political and religious institutions; (6) culture involves historical processes; and (7) complex culture is uniquely human-we need an explanation for why the human species alone evolved such extensive social learning aptitudes. I suggest that these controversies can be resolved, although empirical tests are difficult. I posit that social competition was a primary selective pressure on human mental abilities (Alexander 1989) and that this favored domain-general, constructivist learning capabilities (e.g., Quartz and Sejnowski, in press) that can manage context-dependent analysis and integrate information from domain-specific mechanisms (Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994; MacDonald 1991; Sperber 1996). Humans are unique in the extraordinary levels of novelty that are generated by the processing of socially learned information. Human culture is cumulative; human cognition produces new ideas built upon the old. To a degree that far surpasses that of any other species, human mental processes must contend with a constantly changing information environment of their own creation. Cultural information may be especially dynamic because it is a fundamental aspect of human social competition. Apparently arbitrary changes in cultural traits, such as clothing styles, music, art, food, dialects, and so forth, may reflect information arms races among social competitors. The remarkable developmental plasticity and cross domain integration of some cognitive mechanisms may be products of selection for special sensitivity to variable social context. Human `'culture'' is not just a pool or source of information; it is an arena and theater of social manipulation and competition. Studies of human behavior-including language, kinship, mating relationships, subsistence, economics, and politics-generally are consistent with an evolutionary basis for social learning, but often they fail to add specific new knowledge about the mechanisms. Analyses of cognitive aptitudes underlying language, kinship, and so forth, often are inconclusive because cultural information (and consequent behavior) involves complex interaction among history, environmental variation, ontogenetic pathways of mental processes, and specific context. I suggest that empirical tests of evolutionary culture theory must build upon identification of apparent universals and examine individual variability by incorporating developmental psychology, environmental conditions, and social and historical context. This synthesis would benefit from enhanced cooperation between cognitive psychologists and cultural anthropologists. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.",MA84,MW,exclude,,
Private benefits and metabolic conflicts shape the emergence of microbial interdependencies,"Microbes perform many costly biological functions that benefit themselves, and may also benefit neighbouring cells. Losing the ability to perform such functions can be advantageous due to cost savings, but when they are essential for growth, organisms become dependent on ecological partners to compensate for those losses. When multiple functions may be lost, the ecological outcomes are potentially diverse, including independent organisms only; one-way dependency, where one partner performs all functions and others none; or mutual interdependency where partners perform complementary essential functions. What drives these different outcomes? We develop a model where organisms perform 'leaky' functions that provide both private and public benefits to explore the consequences of privatization level, costs and essentiality on influencing these outcomes. We show that mutual interdependency is favoured at intermediate levels of privatization for a broad range of conditions. One-way dependency, in contrast, is only favoured when privatization is low and loss-of-function benefits are accelerating. Our results suggest an interplay between privatization level and shape of benefits from loss in driving microbial dependencies. Given the ubiquity of microbial functions that are inevitably leaked and the ease of mutational inactivation, our findings may help to explain why microbial interdependencies are common in nature.  2016 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",MA294,MW,include,interspecific or intraspecific?,mutualism
Genetic evidence confirms polygamous mating system in a crustacean parasite with multiple hosts,"Mating systems are diverse in animals, notably in crustaceans, but can be inferred from a limited set of parameters. Baeza and Thiel (2007) proposed a model predicting mating systems of symbiotic crustaceans with three host characteristics and the risk of predation. These authors proposed five mating systems, ranging from monogamy to polygynandry (where multiple mating occurs for both genders). Using microsatellite loci, we tested the putatively mating system of the ectoparasite crab Dissodactylus primitivus. We determined the mating frequencies of males and females, parentage assignment (COLONY &GERUD software) as well as the contents of female spermathecae. Our results are globally consistent with the model of Baeza and Thiel and showed, together with previous aquarium experiments, that this ectoparasite evolved a polygamous mating system where males and females move between hosts for mate search. Parentage analyses revealed that polyandry is frequent and concerns more than 60% of clutches, with clutches being fertilized by up to 6 different fathers. Polygyny is supported by the detection of eight males having sired two different broods. We also detected a significant paternity skew in 92% of the multipaternal broods. Moreover, this skew is probably higher than the estimation from the brood because additional alleles were detected in most of spermathecae. This high skew could be explained by several factors as sperm competition or cryptic female choice. Our genetic data, combined with previous anatomic analyses, provide consistent arguments to suggest sperm precedence in D. primitivus.  2014 Jossart et al.",MA165,MW,exclude,,
"Chemical ecology of mobile benthic invertebrates: Predators and prey, allies and competitors","The diversity of topics addressed in this volume attests to the fact that marine chemical ecology is more than just animals and plants producing chemicals that deter predation. Chemicals are involved in mediating a diverse array of inter- and intraspecific interactions including predation, competition, mutualism, and reproductive processes, as well as interactions between organisms and their physical environment. This diversity is best exemplified in the mobile invertebrates. Mobile invertebrates are the dominant predators and herbivores in many marine systems and serve as keystone species in several of these systems. Thus, factors (including chemistry) that determine their distribution, abundance, and impact on communities and ecosystems should be of broad interest to marine biologists and ecologists. Straightforward production of predator-deterrent chemicals is rare in this group as compared to sessile invertebrates and seaweeds, and this has led the ecologists and chemists studying these organisms to diversify in terms of the types of interactions they study. Waterborne chemicals help mobile invertebrates locate food, mates, and appropriate habitats or symbiotic partners; they also help regulate and synchronize reproductive cycles and alert organisms to the danger of nearby predators. Nevertheless, the bulk of research on chemically mediated interactions has focused on predator-prey interactions, so much of the chapter is necessarily devoted to these interactions. In areas where rigorous studies involving mobile benthic invertebrates are rare (e.g., antifouling and allelopathy), examples from other groups (plants, sessile invertebrates, or vertebrates) or habitats (open water marine, freshwater, or terrestrial) are provided to identify areas deserving increased attention. More detailed treatments of particular types of interactions or habitats can be found in the other chapters of this volume.  2001 by CRC Press LLC.",MA44,MW,exclude,,
Social cognition,"The social intelligence hypothesis argues that competition and cooperation among individuals have shaped the evolution of cognition in animals. What do we mean by social cognition? Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.

Social behaviour and gut microbiota in red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer): In search of the role of immunity in the evolution of sociality,"Vertebrate gut microbiota form a key component of immunity and a dynamic link between an individual and the ecosystem. Microbiota might play a role in social systems as well, because microbes are transmitted during social contact and can affect host behaviour. Combining methods from behavioural and molecular research, we describe the relationship between social dynamics and gut microbiota of a group-living cooperative species of primate, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Specifically, we ask whether patterns of social contact (group membership, group size, position in social network, individual sociality) are associated with patterns of gut microbial composition (diversity and similarity) between individuals and across time. Red-bellied lemurs were found to have gut microbiota with slight temporal fluctuations and strong social group-specific composition. Contrary to expectations, individual sociality was negatively associated with gut microbial diversity. However, position within the social network predicted gut microbial composition. These results emphasize the role of the social environment in determining the microbiota of adult animals. Since social transmission of gut microbiota has the potential to enhance immunity, microbiota might have played an escalating role in the evolution of sociality.  2017 The Authors.

Does the Reproductive Strategy Affect the Transmission and Genetic Diversity of Bionts in Cyanolichens? A Case Study Using Two Closely Related Species,"Observed levels of population genetic diversity are often associated with differences in species dispersal and reproductive strategies. In symbiotic organisms, the genetic diversity level of each biont should also be highly influenced by biont transmission. In this study, we evaluated the influence of the reproductive strategies of cyanolichen species on the current levels of population genetic diversity of bionts. To eliminate any phylogenetic noise, we selected two closely related species within the genus Degelia, which only differ in their reproductive systems. We sampled all known populations of both species in central Spain and genotyped the fungal and cyanobacterial components of lichen samples using DNA sequences as molecular markers. We applied population genetics approaches to evaluate the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of the symbiotic components of both lichen species. Our results indicate that fungal and cyanobiont genetic diversity is highly influenced by the reproductive systems of lichen fungus. We detected higher bionts genetic diversity values in the sexual species Degelia plumbea. By contrast, the levels of fungal and cyanobiont genetic diversity in the asexual species Degelia atlantica were extremely low (almost clonal), and the species shows a high specificity towards its cyanobiont. Our results indicate that reproduction by vegetative propagules, in species of the genus Degelia, favors vertical transmission and clonality, which affects the species' capacity for resources and competition, thereby limiting the species to restricted niches.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",MA104,MW,exclude,,
"Male dominance relationships in an extremely large chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda","Male dominance hierarchies occur in many group-living primates and some non-primate mammals. Variation in aspects of agonistic relationships such as how many dyads show bidirectionality in aggression leads to variation in dominance hierarchies along a continuum from egalitarian (relatively small agonistic power differences between adjacently-ranked individuals, shallow hierarchies) to despotic (relatively large differences, steep hierarchies). Ranks usually depend mostly or entirely on individual characteristics that influence fighting ability (e.g., body size) and show inverse-U shaped relationships to age. However, coalitionary support sometimes also influences ranks. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) form multi-male, multi-female communities within which males compete for status. Males typically form dominance hierarchies, and data from multiple study show that rank is positively related to paternity success. Males also often form coalitions and some dyads form long-term alliances. Effective coalitionary support can help individuals improve and maintain their ranks, and some evidence supports the hypothesis that coalitionary aggression generally, and the positions that males hold in coalitions networks specifically, influences paternity success. Hierarchy steepness varies among communities and within communities over time; variation in the number of prime-aged males per community is a likely source of this variation. Long-term data from an extremely large chimpanzee community with unusually many males, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, are largely consistent with previous analyses of male chimpanzee dominance hierarchies, but show several notable contrasts. Males at Ngogo formed significantly linear hierarchies and hierarchy steepness was greater than expected if the outcomes of agonistic interactions were random. However, variation in steepness did not show the significant inverse relationship to the number of ``prime-aged{''} males documented for other chimpanzee communities and average steepness was high given the large number of males. Ranks showed an inverse-U shaped relationship to age, although individual rank trajectories varied considerably, but males attained their highest lifetime ranks at later ages and maintained relatively high ranks to later ages than those at other chimpanzee research sites. Two measures of coalition networks, strength and Bonacich power, showed significant positive relationships with male ranks. Strength is the rate at which males joined coalitions. Bonacich power is a measure of network centrality that assesses a male's relational power, or influence (Bonacich, 1987): a male with high Bonacich power formed coalitions with relatively many other males who were also central in the coalition network, i.e., he was strongly connected to powerful others. On average, males also attained maximum values for these and other network measures relatively late and maintained relatively high values to relatively late ages. High coalition network strength, Bonacich power, and eigenvector centrality early in adulthood were associated with high peak ranks at later ages. However, the direction of causality between participation in coalition networks and ranks is not yet clear, and the effects of body size on dominance ranks and individual rank trajectories remains to be explored. Ngogo is a favourable habitat for chimpanzees and survivorship there is unusually high; this presumably facilitates the ability of males to maintain high competitive ability longer than at other sites and shifts rank trajectories toward older ages and leads to relatively steep hierarchies despite the fact that many male dyads have similar competitive ability. Future work will assess the impact of coalitions on dominance relationships in more detail and the relationship of coalitionary aggression to paternity success.",MA234,MW,exclude,,
Manipulation of population density and food availability affects home range sizes of African striped mouse females,"An individual's home range determines its access to resources, significantly influencing its fitness. Food availability and population density are considered to be among the primary factors influencing home range sizes; however, no study has experimentally tested whether these two factors affect home range sizes independently. This is important as these two factors correlate significantly with each other, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of one from the other. First, we supplemented food to 23 female African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, belonging to 15 different groups. To avoid an increase in population density by immigration, we also provided food to neighbouring groups. Although population density did not increase, female home range sizes decreased by 43.1\%. In a second experiment, we manipulated population density by removing entire social groups of striped mice. We carried out experiments within 7 weeks, a period short enough to control for a change in natural food availability. Experimental decrease of population density caused an increase of female home range sizes of 44.3\%. The degree of home range overlap between female striped mice was unaffected by supplemental feeding or by reduction of population density. However, female home range sizes were negatively affected by the total number of female neighbours, especially of heavier individuals. In addition, after removal, females significantly decreased their overlap with neighbouring breeding females indicating that competition with same-sex individuals shapes females' home ranges. This is the first comprehensive experimental field study demonstrating that an increase in food availability and a decrease in population density independently affect home range sizes of individuals.

Conflicting selection in the course of adaptive diversification: The interplay between mutualism and intraspecific competition,"Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency- dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems. Hence, different processes, such as trait convergence favoring the incorporation of nonrelated species, are needed to explain the higher richness of low-intimacy assemblages-shown here to be up to 1 order of magnitude richer than high-intimacy systems.  2014 by The University of Chicago.",MA71,MW,exclude,,
