"11","MA108","Dominant and subordinate outside options alter help and eviction in a pay-to-stay negotiation model","In several cooperatively breeding species, subordinates that do not help sufficiently are punished or evicted from the group by dominant individuals. The credibility of dominant eviction threats may vary with the social context beyond the group level: when subordinates can easily breed in a neighboring territory, dominants may be less able to demand help from subordinates. Further, dominant ability to enforce subordinate cooperation may be reduced when it is difficult to replace evicted subordinates or in small groups where each subordinate makes a large contribution to group productivity. Here, we develop a 2-player game theoretic model to examine how the social context influences subordinate help and the threshold of help at which dominants evict subordinates. In contrast to predictions, we found that dominants demand more help when dominants are less able to replace evicted subordinates, suggesting that dominants punish a dereliction of helping behavior more strongly when they are unable to compensate for the loss of an evicted subordinate. In single sealed-bid games, subordinates help less than the fitness costs they impose on dominants and help does not vary with subordinate breeding opportunities outside the group. However, when subordinates can plastically increase help in response to demanding dominants (akin to pay-to-stay dynamics), subordinates provide more help overall, but decrease their help as breeding opportunities outside of the group increase. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating negotiation into theoretical models of helping strategies and demonstrate that plasticity is a key mechanism underlying pay-to-stay mechanisms of cooperation.","CF","include","intraspecific","Sociality - cooperation, modelling","","Dominant and subordinate outside options alter help and eviction in a pay-to-stay negotiation model","In several cooperatively breeding species, subordinates that do not help sufficiently are punished or evicted from the group by dominant individuals.

Although their general life histories are relatively similar, different species vary markedly in the physiological condition of the hosts they select. Most of 6000 known species colonise dead or stressed trees, a resource they share with a large diversity of insects and other organisms. A small number of bark beetle species kill healthy, live trees. These few are of particular interest as they compete directly with humans for resources. We propose that tree killing evolved when intense interspecific competition in the ephemeral, scarce resource of defence-impaired trees selected for genotypes that allowed them to escape this limitation by attacking relatively healthy trees. These transitions were uncommon, and we suggest they were facilitated by (a) genetically and phenotypically flexible host selection behaviours, (b) biochemical adaptations for detoxifying a wide range of defence compounds, and (c) associations with symbionts, which together aided bark beetles in overcoming formidable constitutive and induced host defences. The ability to detoxify terpenes influenced the evolutionary course of pheromonal communication. Specifically, a mate attraction system, which was exploited by intraspecific competitors in locating poorly defended hosts, became a system of cooperative attack in which emitters benefit from the contributions responders make in overcoming defence. This functional shift in communication was driven in part by linkage of beetle semiochemistry to host defence chemistry. Behavioural and phenological adaptations also improved the beetles' abilities to detect when tree defences are impaired, and, where compatible with life history adaptations to other selective forces, for flight to coincide with seasonally predictable host stress agents. We propose a conceptual model, whereby the above mechanisms enable beetles to concentrate on those trees that offer an optimal trade-off between host defence and interspecific competition, along dynamic gradients of tree vigour and stand-level beetle density.

This study investigates the effect of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus (Cuvier and Valenciennes) on the host damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis (Bleeker) by excluding all cleaner fish from 8 reefs for 6 months at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. The subsequent effect of cleaner removal on parasites (total number, number per category of parasite, and size of parasite) and host abundance was estimated and compared to control reefs where L. dimidiatus were not removed. Parasite loads of P. moluccensis were low (usually 0-3 per fish) on all reefs after the experiment, and were dominated by small copepod larvae (260-1370 mu m). The removal of L. dimidiatus had no detectable effect on the mean number of parasites per host, either across all parasite taxa combined or by each parasite taxon individually.

We sought to determine whether adult favouritism or intrabrood competition over the distribution of natal food resources provides a mechanism for the persistence of individual variation in natal dispersal strategies. We show that fledgling red-cockaded woodpeckers form male-biased, linear dominance hierarchies as a result of frequent aggressive conflicts. For males, high nestling condition relative to male broodmates was a strong predictor of future dominance, and this condition-rank relationship persisted after individuals reached nutritional independence. Adults were never observed interfering with broodmate conflicts, and were only rarely aggressive towards fledglings. Adults showed no overt favouritism towards offspring when targeting individual fledglings during provisioning early in the postfledging period. However, conflict rates increased with decreasing targeted-feeding rates, suggesting that access to resources is an important function of dominance hierarchies. After fledglings were developmentally able to compete for positions near foraging adults, first-and second-ranking males were fed more often than subordinate females. Of the juvenile males surviving to spring, subordinates were more likely to disperse during their first year than were their dominant broodmates.

Experienced females were relatively more likely to abandon a single cuckoo chick and accept a single fairy-wren chick than naive females. Breeding experience therefore facilitates the ability to make an accurate rejection decision, perhaps through learned refinement of the recognition template.

This article compares five epistemologies including the two mentioned above in the context of the current epistemological transition in science, particularly due to the emergence of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in physics and differentiation-amplifying reciprocal causal models in mathematics and engineering, both of which consider the universe as pattern-generating, information-creating and evolving.  1977 Leiden University Press/Dr. W.

We habituated macaques without provisioning mainly in the coastal warm-temperate forest and found that they lived in small troops with a high socionomic sex ratio. Observations of several troop fissions and troop takeovers by nontroop males suggest that Yakushima macaques have a different social organization from that of Japanese macaques in other habitats. For example, youngest ascendancy as the dominance relationhip among sisters, which usually occurs in provisioned troops, was absent in Yakushima macaques. We compared their ecological and social features with those of Japanese macaques at Kinkazan (cool-temperate forests) and found that abundance of high-quality foods may cause stronger intra- and intertroop competition at Yakushima. Female Yakushima macaques may more positively solicit nontroop males to associate with them during the mating season. Such a tendency may promote frequent male movement between troops and frequent troop fissions. Though ecological factors form social features of Japanese macaques, some features such as male association and movements between troops are not accounted for via socioecology. Recent field studies have focused on macaques living at higher altitudes in Yakushima and on individual survival strategies by taking diverse viewpoints and using new technologies. DNA analysis of fecal samples shows low genetic diversity and suggests the macaques' recent expansion from lowland to highland forests in Yakushima. The population censuses conducted annually indicate that the higher-altitude macaques have a larger home range but a similar group size versus their counterparts at low elevations. The unsolved issues in socioecology will pose a challenge to the younger generation of primatologists. Conservation of macaques and their habitat is one of our major activities at Yakushima.

For that purpose, we measured the frequency of single and double infections, estimated the parasite loads of single and double infections, and determined the type of correlation between both parasites in double infections. If interactions between both parasites are strong and antagonistic, single infections should be more frequent than double infections, double infections will have lower parasite loads than single infections, and double infections will present a negative correlation. Overall, a total of 88 workers were infected with N.ceranae, 53 with L.passim, and eight with both parasites.

Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of variation in the genetic composition and function of rhizobial communities is critical to understanding rhizobial impacts on community and ecosystem productivity. In this study, we examined how environmental factors and host species jointly affect rhizobial phenotypic diversity and community structure. Individual host plants of two native Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and A.stenophylla, were inoculated with a community of six rhizobial strains (belonging to three genera) previously characterized for symbiotic effectiveness. The plants were grown in a fully factorial experiment under high and low phosphorus and water, and high or no nitrogen. Half the plants were harvested after 19weeks and the other half after 30weeks. The relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was characterized using amplicon sequencing of the rhizobial 16S rRNA gene from DNA extracted from the root nodules of plants after each harvest. Variation in the relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was best explained by host species, although interactions between environment and host species also emerged as significant predictors of variation in rhizobial community composition. We detected strong host-specific interactions for two strains, while two other strains were clearly generalists, being relatively abundant in both host species. For both host species, the two generalist strains were as abundant as the best specialist strain within the rhizobial community. Synthesis. Our study show host species identity as the key determinant of rhizobial community structure within the root nodules of Acacia plants. Strains that were efficient at promoting the growth of their host plant had high relative abundance in experimental communities. Furthermore, interaction among host species, rhizobial host-range, and environmental variation determine the structure of rhizobial communities, although not in clearly predictable ways. Such interactions contributed to the maintenance (albeit at relatively low frequencies) of ineffective strains in nodule communities.

Methods: We grew a native ruderal plant community composed of different functional groups (grasses, legumes and forbs) in the presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and endogeic earthworms in mesocosms. We introduced seeds of five, mainly exotic, plant species from the same functional groups after a disturbance simulating mowing. The effects of the soil organisms on the native ruderal plant community and seedling establishment of the newcomer plants were assessed. Results: After disturbance, the total above-ground regrowth of the native plant community was not affected by the soil organisms. However, AMF increased plant diversity and shoot biomass of forbs, but decreased shoot biomass of grasses of the native plant community. Earthworms led to a reduction in total root biomass.

Social complexity is a broadly used term that encompasses many individual and colony-level traits and characteristics such as colony size, polymorphism and foraging strategy. A number of earlier studies have considered the relationships among various correlates of social complexity in insect societies; in this review, we build upon those studies by proposing additional correlates and show how all correlates can be integrated in a common explanatory framework. The various correlates are divided among four broad categories (sections). Under 'polyphenism' we consider the differences among individuals, in particular focusing upon 'caste' and specialization of individuals. This is followed by a section on 'totipotency' in which we consider the autonomy and subjugation of individuals. Under this heading we consider various aspects such as intracolony conflict, worker reproductive potential and physiological or morphological restrictions which limit individuals' capacities to perform a range of tasks or functions. A section entitled 'organization of work' considers a variety of aspects, e.g. the ability to tackle group, team or partitioned tasks, foraging strategics and colony reliability and efficiency. A final section, 'communication and functional integration', considers how individual activity is coordinated to produce an integrated and adaptive colony. Within each section we use illustrative examples drawn from the social insect literature (mostly from ants, for which there is the best data) to illustrate concepts or trends and make a number of predictions concerning how a particular trait is expected to correlate with other aspects of social complexity. Within each section we also expand the scope of the arguments to consider these relationships in a much broader sense of 'sociality' by drawing parallels with other 'social' entities such as multicellular individuals, which can be understood as 'societies' of cells. The aim is to draw out any parallels and common causal relationships among the correlates. Two themes run through the study. The first is the role of colony size as an important factor affecting social complexity. The second is the complexity of individual workers in relation to the complexity of the colony. Consequently, this is an ideal opportunity to test a previously proposed hypothesis that 'individuals of highly social ant species arc less complex than individuals from simple ant species' in light of numerous social correlates. Our findings support this hypothesis. In summary, we conclude that, in general, complex societies arc characterized by large colony size, worker polymorphism, strong behavioural specialization and loss of totipotency in its workers, low individual complexity, decentralized colony control and high system redundancy, low individual competence, a high degree of worker cooperation when tackling tasks, group foraging strategies, high tempo, multi-chambered tailor-made nests, high functional integration, relatively greater use of cues and modulatory signals to coordinate individuals and heterogeneous patterns of worker-worker interaction.","KJB","include","intraspecific","review, eusocial insects","Not sure (again)","Individual versus social complexity, with particular reference to ant colonies","Insect societies - colonies of ants, bees, wasps and termites vary enormously in their social complexity.

"135","MA22","Aphid-encoded variability in susceptibility to a parasitoid","Background: Many animals exhibit variation in resistance to specific natural enemies. Such variation may be encoded in their genomes or derived from infection with protective symbionts. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, for example, exhibits tremendous variation in susceptibility to a common natural enemy, the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi. Pea aphids are often infected with the heritable bacterial symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, which confers partial to complete resistance against this parasitoid depending on bacterial strain and associated bacteriophages. That previous studies found that pea aphids without H. defensa (or other symbionts) were generally susceptible to parasitism, together with observations of a limited encapsulation response, suggested that pea aphids largely rely on infection with H. defensa for protection against parasitoids. However, the limited number of uninfected clones previously examined, and our recent report of two symbiont-free resistant clones, led us to explicitly examine aphid-encoded variability in resistance to parasitoids. Results: After rigorous screening for known and unknown symbionts, and microsatellite genotyping to confirm clonal identity, we conducted parasitism assays using fifteen clonal pea aphid lines. We recovered significant variability in aphid-encoded resistance, with variation levels comparable to that contributed by H. defensa. Because resistance can be costly, we also measured aphid longevity and cumulative fecundity of the most and least resistant aphid lines under permissive conditions, but found no trade-offs between higher resistance and these fitness parameters. Conclusions: These results indicate that pea aphid resistance to A. ervi is more complex than previously appreciated, and that aphids employ multiple tactics to aid in their defense. While we did not detect a tradeoff, these may become apparent under stressful conditions or when resistant and susceptible aphids are in direct competition. Understanding sources and amounts of variation in resistance to natural enemies is necessary to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic interactions, such as the potential for coevolution, but also for the successful management of pest populations through biological control.  2014 Martinez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","CM","include","interspecific","host-parasite",NA,"Aphid-encoded variability in susceptibility to a parasitoid","Background: Many animals exhibit variation in resistance to specific natural enemies.

In this study we show a strong association between foliar domatia and mites in 37 plant species in Australasia. Overall, mites accounted for 91% of the arthropods observed in domatia. Across all species, a median of 51% of domatia were occupied and 71% of leaves showed mite evidence in domatia. The level of mite association did not depend on domatia type (pit, pouch, pocket, or tuft) or provenance (Papua New Guinea, Queensland, Victoria, or New Zealand). Mite association with domatia commonly varied between plant species, between individuals within species, and between shoots within individuals. The leaf developmental stage probably explains much of the variation in association for many of these species. The presence of a variety of life history stages of mites within domatia indicates that these structures act as shelters for development and reproduction. Furthermore, in 12 of 13 plant species examined, domatia concentrate mites in particular locations on the leaf. Mite taxa that we classify as largely predaceous (e.g. phytoseiids, stigmaeids and tydeids) or fungivorous (e.g. acarids and oribatids) were most common in domatia and dominated the association in 21 of 24 plant species in which the relative abundance of herbivorous, fungivorous and predaceous groups was quantified. We evaluate hypotheses that explain the role of leaf domatia, including nonfunctional hypotheses (e.g. architectural constraints), physiological function (e.g. gas exchange and water uptake), bacterial symbiosis and antagonistic and mutualistic associations with mites.

Fighting in between-group conflicts carries an opportunity cost, a risk of injury or death, and the possibility of exploitation by free-riding group members. As a result, it is rare that all group members fight in a given between-group conflict, and individual participation in range defence is often highly variable. Thus, to understand the patterns of behaviour observed at the group level, we must first understand the causes of within- and between-individual variability. Although sex differences have been well studied, our understanding of the relative importance of the various mechanisms promoting between-group aggression within a sex is limited. We observed the participation of 22 male vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, in 126 between-group conflicts, and then partitioned aggressive acts according to the context in which they occurred. Using this approach, we found evidence that two mechanisms drive male between-group aggression and, therefore, that individual variability is in part driven by the multiple selective benefits of participation. First, males that were likely to have sired offspring tended to exhibit defensive aggression and were more active when infants were present in the group, suggesting they fight to defend probable offspring. Second, males were more likely to support females in initiating between-group aggression just prior to, and during, the mating season. Female vervet monkeys are able to exert female choice, and males that frequently supported female instigators tended to enjoy the highest mating success. These results indicate that males probably use between-group aggression to improve their reputation with choosy females and subsequently maximize their mating success.

During an evolutionary transition, for example, from single cells to multicellular organisms, the new higher-level evolutionary unit (multicellular organism) gains its emergent properties by virtue of the interactions among lower-level units (cells). We see the formation of cooperative interactions among lower-level units as a necessary step in evolutionary transitions; only cooperation transfers fitness from lower levels (costs to group members) to higher levels (benefits to the group). As cooperation creates new levels of fitness, it creates the opportunity for conflict between levels as deleterious mutants arise and spread within the group. Fundamental to the emergence of a new higher-level unit is the mediation of conflict among lower-level units in favor of the higher-level unit. The acquisition of heritable variation in fitness at the new level, via conflict mediation, requires the reorganization of the basic components of fitness (survival and reproduction) and life-properties (such as immortality and totipotency) as well as the co-option of lower-level processes for new functions at the higher level. The way in which the conflicts associated with the transition in individuality have been mediated, and fitness and general life-traits have been re-organized, can influence the potential for further evolution (i.e., evolvability) of the newly emerged evolutionary individual.

Our results show that antipredator responses of breeding great tits are dependent on their personality and personality type of neighbouring conspecifics. We found that neophilic individuals (those that rapidly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) have an advantage over neophobic individuals (those that slowly resumed feeding of nestlings in the presence of a novel object) in their reproductive success, as measured in numbers of successful nests and of females that survived. Furthermore, neophilic-neophilic pairs exhibited stronger antipredator mobbing responses than neophobic-neophobic pairs. Results show that consistent individual differences in response against novel objects and antipredator behaviour are related, and that these responses are important predictors of nest failure in breeding great tits.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.","MW","exclude","","",""

Such variation is primary in providing one mechanism of reproductive isolation. Secondary physiological variation functions in habitat selection, particularly after reproductive isolation. Criteria for physiological variation are given by measurement of internal state in relation to environmental stress.

Both regulation and adjustment are adaptive to environmental change; in both types, phenotypic variation must be distinguished from genotypic variation. Examples of physiological variation in osmotic adaptation, in different populations of the same species, are given for species of Paramecium, Euplotes, Asterias, Gammarus, Callinectes, Anopheles, Onchorhynchus and Gasterosteus. Genetically different races have been established for Gasterosteus aculeatus and Euplotes vassus. Ionic balance has been little studied as a basis for variation of populations but specific requirements for some elements, such as copper and calcium, may have led to local differences. Stress of temperature extremes has induced many physiological variants. Closely related large homoiotherms differ in insulating capacity, smaller species differ also in metabolic response, particularly to cold. Poikilotherms differ in tolerance limits after acclimation, in selected temperatures, in metabolic level according to their temperature history, in Q 10 , in critical temperatures for reproduction and development. Physiological races with respect to temperature tolerance or selection are cited for species of Notropis, Micropterus, Gambusia, Pandalus and Carabus.

Examples of races with respect to optimal temperature of development are found in species of Paramecium, Crassostrea, Urosalpinx, Daphnia, Drosophila, Lymantria and Rana.

Selection of specific food plants depends on secondary products, not primary food; many subspecies and races are known by food plant selection, especially among bugs, gall flies and butterflies.

A neglected idea is that geographic phenotypic variation in a host plant may lead to heterogeneous evolutionary responses of the different members of the associated communities. This could result in diversification on a host plant by ecological speciation in some species, leading to geographic variation in community composition. In this study we investigated geographic variation of inflorescence receptacle size in a plant, Ficus hirta, and how the hymenopteran community feeding in the inflorescences has responded. Our predictions were: 1) Inflorescence size variation affects wasp species differently depending on how they access oviposition sites. 2) In some affected lineages of wasps, we may observe vicariant, parapatric species adapted to different inflorescence sizes. Results: We show that fig (the enclosed inflorescence of Ficus) wall thickness varies geographically. The fig entering pollinating wasp was not affected, while the parasites ovipositing through the fig wall were. Two parapatric species of Philotrypesis, exhibiting strikingly different ovipositor lengths, were recorded. One species of Sycoscapter was also present, and it was restricted, like the shorter-ovipositor Philotrypesis, to the geographic zone where fig walls were thinner. Conclusions: Previous work on fig wasps suggested that parapatric geographic ranges among congenerics were due to adaptation to variation in abiotic factors, complemented by interspecific competition. Our results show that parapatric ranges may also result from adaptation to variation in biotic factors. Within an insect community, differences among species in their response to geographic phenotypic variation of their host plant may result in geographically heterogeneous community structure. Such heterogeneity leads to heterogeneous interaction networks among sites.

There are many benefits of group living, but also substantial costs, one of which is competition for resources. How scarce food resources are distributed among different members of a population or social group -whether via scramble or contest competition - can influence not only the variance in individual fitness, but also the stability and therefore survival of the group or population. 2. Attributes of the food resources themselves, such as their size, may influence the type of intraspecific competition that occurs and therefore the intrinsic stability of a group or population. 3. By experimentally manipulating the size of prey fed to artificial colonies of the social spider Anelosimus eximius, we investigated whether prey size could alter the degree of scramble vs. contest competition that takes place and, thus, potentially influence colony population dynamics. 4. We found that large prey were shared more evenly than small prey and that individuals in poor condition were more likely to feed when prey were large than when prey were small. Additionally, we show that individuals participating in prey capture are also more likely to feed on the captured prey. 5. We developed a simple mathematical model to explore the prey sizes that would be energetically worth defending, i.e. prey that are `economically defendable'. The model shows that neither very small prey, nor prey above a certain size is worth monopolizing, with only intermediate size prey being `economically defendable'. We therefore suggest the small and large prey in our experiment corresponds to our model's intermediate and large prey categories, respectively. 6. As the size of prey captured by social spider colonies increases with colony size, our findings suggest that scramble competition may predominate in large colonies. Scramble competition, combined with the fact that prey biomass per capita declines as colonies grow beyond a certain size, would then explain why extremely large colonies of this social spider may suddenly go extinct. Our project thus illustrates the potential triple link between characteristics of the resources, individual behaviour and population dynamics, a link rarely considered in an empirical setting.","KJB","include","interspecific","Predator-prey, competition, experiment, modelling","","Prey size and scramble vs. contest competition in a social spider: implications for population dynamics","1.

One constructive criticism of the theory is that there are too many models, all of which have different assumptions and predictions, which makes it difficult to know what to test. Here we begin the process of tackling this problem, by re-examining the assumptions and predictions of basic concession and restraint models, two transactional models that are often tested as alternatives. Concession models assume that the dominant has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may yield some of the group's reproduction to prevent the subordinate from voluntarily departing. Restraint models assume that the subordinate has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may not claim all of the group's reproduction to prevent the dominant from forcibly evicting it. We show that the group dissolution tactics that individuals use ( forcible eviction or voluntary departure) need not be an assumption of the model, but rather they can be predicted using Hamilton's rule and the standard variables of skew models. We reveal that the assumption that one individual ( dominant or subordinate) has complete control over the allocation of reproduction is an idea common to both models, and we resolve this semantic difference by calling this individual `the allocator'. We show that, regardless of the group dissolution tactics that individuals adopt, the allocator's share of the reproduction always increases as relatedness increases, as group productivity increases, and as constraints on leaving to breed elsewhere intensify. We conclude that concession and restraint type models make qualitatively similar predictions, and should not be tested as alternatives. In summary, this study makes the transactional framework of reproductive skew more general, by eliminating restrictive assumptions, and more amenable to testing in the field, by clarifying assumptions and predictions.

In socio-ecological contexts in which adults monogamously partner and cooperate to raise children, individuals with unrestricted sociosexuality are likely to prioritize mating/competition over committed partnering and parenting. Given the importance of mother-father cooperation in the evolutionary past, humans may have the capacity to facultatively and opportunistically downregulate sociosexuality to focus on priorities related to invested partnering and parenting. To date, no prior studies have used longitudinal data to track within-individuals changes in sociosexuality as it relates to such life history transitions. Given the lack of prior longitudinal research in this area, it is likewise unknown what physiological mechanisms might mediate within-individual changes in sociosexuality through time but testosterone is a plausible candidate. To explore these questions, we drew on a large, long-running study of Filipino men (n = 288), who were single non-fathers at 25.9 years of age and were followed up 4-5 years later. We found that men with more unrestricted sociosexuality at baseline were more likely to experience relationship dissolution by follow-up, consistent with past work.

Thermal stress was higher in deer than in sheep, with less differences between species in summer. Deer travelled more distance than sheep, and both species travelled more in summer than in winter; deer travel distance showed less seasonal differences than sheep. Animal movement was better predicted in deer than in sheep and in winter than in summer; both species showed a swarming behaviour in group cohesion, stronger in deer. At shorter separation distances swarming repulsion was stronger between species than within species. At longer separation distances inter-specific attraction was weaker than intra-specific; there was a positive density-dependent effect on swarming, and stronger in deer than in sheep. There was not clear evidence which species attracted or repelled the other; attraction between deer at long separation distances was stronger when the model accounted for thermal stress, but in general the dynamic movement behaviour was hardly affected by the thermal stress.

"319","MA386","The social context of a territorial dispute differentially influences the way individuals in breeding pairs coordinate their aggressive tactics","Abstract: In diverse species, individuals coordinate behavior to accomplish shared goals or tasks. Such coordination, however, often occurs selectively, and the contextual information animals use to determine when they coordinate and when they do not is unclear. We investigate this issue in the highly territorial downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) by exploring how individuals within a social breeding pair differentially modulate coordinated aggressive responses during graded simulated territorial intrusions (STIs). Analyses show that resident pairs mount a more robust aggressive response to STIs that represent a greater threat. Moreover, in this social context, pair members produce contact vocalizations in a way that predicts their partners aggressive behavior. We also show that, when presented with a low threat, individuals that first respond to intrusions decrease their aggressive output once their partner attends to the stimulus; the partner, in turn, increases their levels of aggressive behavior. This does not occur in high-threat STIs, where both partners maintain high levels of aggression throughout the entire encounter. Together, these results show that individuals within a pair flexibly adjust their aggressive tactics in response to different social competitive contexts, and this includes adjusting the way in which individuals coordinate certain aspects of their agonistic repertoire. We speculate that this ability reflects an adaptive mechanism that allows individuals to fine-tune territorial tactics to reduce overall costs of aggression. Significance statement: Although research has demonstrated that individuals often coordinate their behavior to accomplish common tasks, little is known about the factors that determine when such coordination occurs and when it does not. We address this issue for the first time in the highly territorial downy woodpecker by testing how the level of threat associated with a territorial interaction influences the coordination of defensive behavior. We find that, when facing intruders that pose a greater threat, residents adjust levels of aggressive output in response to the number of vocalizations produced by their breeding partner. By contrast, this relationship is not observed when pairs face intruders that pose a relatively lower threat. Our data therefore provide striking evidence that coordination in defensive tactics depends on the residents appraisal of the social context, such that fiercer competition is associated with greater behavioral coordination.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CF","include","intraspecific","aggression, territoriality","","The social context of a territorial dispute differentially influences the way individuals in breeding pairs coordinate their aggressive tactics","Abstract: In diverse species, individuals coordinate behavior to accomplish shared goals or tasks.

In response to signals of danger, aphids also protect not themselves but their offspring by producing more winged than unwinged offspring as a way to ensure that their progeny may be able to escape deteriorating conditions. Such transgenerational wing induction has been studied most commonly as a response to overcrowding of host plants and presence of predators, but recent evidence suggests that pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) may also begin to produce a greater proportion of winged offspring when infected with fungal pathogens. Here, we explore this phenomenon further by asking how protective symbionts, pathogen dosage and environmental conditions influence this response.

"329","MA395","Transitivity and structural balance in marmot social networks","Social relationships are composed of both positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) interactions, representing opposing effects. Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a weak definition of structural balance is probably more common than strong structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance. Our study suggests that there are intriguing similarities in social processes across diverse animal societies and that studying triads and network motifs may help identify basic social mechanisms linking local to global structure.Significance statementSocial network theory predicts that basic social mechanisms should lead to similar structural properties across different societies. For example, positive relationships should be transitive (a friend of a friend is a friend), and certain combinations of positive and negative relationships represent conflict and should be unstable over time (e.g., a friend of a friend being an enemy is an unstable state). This latter theory, called structural balance, has rarely been examined in nonhuman societies; hence, we tested for transitivity and structural balance in groups of free-living yellow-bellied marmots. Positive interactions were generally transitive, but evidence for structural balance was inconsistent.

Social network theory predicts that positive relationships should be transitive; thus, the friend of a friend is more likely to be a friend. Further, when considering both positive and negative relationships jointly, structural balance theory predicts that certain configurations of positive and negative relationships in a triad are inherently less stable (unbalanced) and should tend to be eliminated. However, structural balance has been rarely examined in nonhuman social systems. We tested for transitivity and structural balance in social networks of socially flexible yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and asked if group size, network density, or group composition affected the degree of structural balance. We found a consistent pattern of significant transitivity in positive interactions, some transitivity in negative interactions, and some evidence of structural balance. In particular, a weak definition of structural balance is probably more common than strong structural balance, which used a stricter definition of balance. Network size limited the ability to detect these social processes, and smaller networks were less likely to show significant transitivity or structural balance. The proportion of adult females in a group affected the level of transitivity but did not affect the degree of structural balance.

In this study, we surveyed and identified Wolbachia strains in four additional Asobara species. We detected Wolbachia in one of these species, but both the identity ( based on wsp gene) and prevalence of the Wolbachia detected in natural population indicate that this host species is not dependent on Wolbachia for oogenesis.

In three lines, aposymbiotic females ( cured from the three Wolbachia strains by antibiotics) can produce some oocytes. However, these aposymbiotic females produce fewer and smaller oocytes than symbiotic ones, and the larvae they produce die before full development.

"379","MA7","Accelerated microevolution in an outer membrane protein (OMP) of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia","Background. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria are key players in the biology of bacterial-host interactions. However, while considerable attention has been given to OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, relatively little is known about the role of these proteins in bacteria that primarily infect invertebrates. One such OMP is found in the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, which are widespread symbionts of arthropods and filarial nematodes. Recent experimental studies have shown that the Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) can trigger host immune responses and control cell death programming in humans, suggesting a key role of WSP for establishment and persistence of the symbiosis in arthropods. Results. Here we performed an analysis of 515 unique alleles found in 831 Wolbachia isolates, to investigate WSP structure, microevolution and population genetics. WSP shows an eight-strand transmembrane -barrel structure with four extracellular loops containing hypervariable regions (HVRs). A clustering approach based upon patterns of HVR haplotype diversity was used to group similar WSP sequences and to estimate the relative contribution of mutation and recombination during early stages of protein divergence. Results indicate that although point mutations generate most of the new protein haplotypes, recombination is a predominant force triggering diversity since the very first steps of protein evolution, causing at least 50% of the total amino acid variation observed in recently diverged proteins. Analysis of synonymous variants indicates that individual WSP protein types are subject to a very rapid turnover and that HVRs can accommodate a virtually unlimited repertoire of peptides. Overall distribution of WSP across hosts supports a non-random association of WSP with the host genus, although extensive horizontal transfer has occurred also in recent times. Conclusions. In OMPs of vertebrate pathogens, large recombination impact, positive selection, reduced structural and compositional constraints, and extensive lateral gene transfer are considered hallmarks of evolution in response to the adaptive immune system. However, Wolbachia do not infect vertebrates. Here we predict that the rapid turnover of WSP loop motifs could aid in evading or inhibiting the invertebrate innate immune response.

"381","MA71","Conflicting selection in the course of adaptive diversification: The interplay between mutualism and intraspecific competition","Adaptive speciation can occur when a population undergoes assortative mating and disruptive selection caused by frequency- dependent intraspecific competition. However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness.

However, other interactions, such as mutualisms based on trait matching, may generate conflicting selective pressures that constrain species diversification. We used individual-based simulations to explore how different types of mutualism affect adaptive diversification. A magic trait was assumed to simultaneously mediate mate choice, intraspecific competition, and mutualisms. In scenarios of intimate, specialized mutualisms, individuals interact with one or few individual mutualistic partners, and diversification is constrained only if the mutualism is obligate. In other scenarios, increasing numbers of different partners per individual limit diversification by generating stabilizing selection. Stabilizing selection emerges from the greater likelihood of trait mismatches for rare, extreme phenotypes than for common intermediate phenotypes. Constraints on diversification imposed by increased numbers of partners decrease if the trait matching degree has smaller positive effects on fitness. These results hold after the relaxation of various assumptions. When trait matching matters, mutualism-generated stabilizing selection would thus often constrain diversification in obligate mutualisms, such as ant-myrmecophyte associations, and in low-intimacy mutualisms, including plant-seed disperser systems.

Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6.

Pups maintained almost constant physical contact with the litter huddle.

Unexpectedly, however, we did not find a relation between huddling index and pups' birth weight, survival, milk intake, or efficiency of converting milk to body mass. We conclude that rather than competing for thermally advantageous positions within the huddle newborn rabbits share out thermally advantageous positions as they move in a continual dynamic flow through it. Thus, in newborn rabbits, competition for the mother's milk exists alongside mutual ``cooperative{''} benefits of littermate presence.","PT","exclude","","",""

Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.","KJB","exclude","","","","Hotspots of damage by antagonists shape the spatial structure of plant-pollinator interactions","The balance between mutualistic and antagonistic plant-animal interactions and their spatial variation results in a highly dynamic mosaic of reproductive success within plant populations.

Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.","NM","include","interspecific","plant-animal interaction; pollinator-host",""

The crop microbiota of Apis mellifera, composed of 13 Lactic Acid Bacterial (LAB) species within the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, form a beneficial symbiotic relationship with each other and the honeybee to protect their niche and their host. Possibly playing a vital role in honeybee health, it is important that these honeybee specific Lactic Acid Bacterial (hbs-LAB) symbionts can be correctly identified, isolated and cultured, to further investigate their health promoting properties. We have previously reported successful identification to the strain level by culturedependent methods and we recently sequenced and annotated the genomes of the 13 hbs- LAB. However, the hitherto applied techniques are unfortunately very time consuming, expensive and not ideal when analyzing a vast quantity of samples. In addition, other researchers have constantly failed to identify the 13 hbs-LAB from honeybee samples by using inadequate media and/or molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing with insufficient discriminatory power. The aim of this study was to develop better and more suitable methods for the identification and cultivation of hbs-LAB. We compared currently used bacterial cultivation media and could for the first time demonstrate a significant variation in the hbs-LAB basic requirements for optimal growth.

"106","MA194","Inclusive fitness, asymmetric competition and kin selection in plants","The findings that some plants alter their competitive phenotype in response to genetic relatedness of its conspecific neighbour (and presumed competitor) has spurred an increasing interest in plant kin-interactions. This phenotypic response suggests the ability to assess the genetic relatedness of conspecific competitors, proposing kin selection as a process that can influence plant competitive interactions. Kin selection can favour restrained competitive growth towards kin, if the fitness loss from reducing own growth is compensated by increased fitness in the related neighbour. This may lead to positive frequency dependency among related conspecifics with important ecological consequences for species assemblage and coexistence. However, kin selection in plants is still controversial. First, many studies documenting a plastic response to neighbour relatedness do not estimate fitness consequences of the individual that responds, and when estimated, fitness of individuals grown in competition with kin did not necessarily exceed that of individuals grown in non-kin groups. Although higher fitness in kin groups could be consistent with kin selection, this could also arise from mechanisms like asymmetric competition in the non-kin groups. Here we outline the main challenges for studying kin selection in plants taking genetic variation for competitive ability into account. We emphasize the need to measure inclusive fitness in order to assess whether kin selection occurs, and show under which circumstances kin selected responses can be expected. We also illustrate why direct fitness estimates of a focal plant, and group fitness estimates are not suitable for documenting kin selection. Importantly, natural selection occurs at the individual level and it is the inclusive fitness of an individual plant - not the mean fitness of the group - that can capture if a differential response to neighbour relatedness is favoured by kin selection.","CF","exclude","","","","Inclusive fitness, asymmetric competition and kin selection in plants","The findings that some plants alter their competitive phenotype in response to genetic relatedness of its conspecific neighbour (and presumed competitor) has spurred an increasing interest in plant kin-interactions.

Unexpectedly, prior predator experience showed no significant effect on inspection behaviour as demonstrated by either the frequency or the duration of each activity outside shelter or on cooperation as demonstrated by the inter-individual distance or synchronization of speed.

The starved fish displayed shorter inspection latency, increased inspection behaviour and greater cooperation when measured without the predator; however, when measured in the presence of the predator, the starved fish showed increased inspection frequency but shorter inspection duration, possibly due to the compromise between energy needs and predation risk. Similar to those of the predation group, the fish from the double-treated group showed no difference in inspection behaviour compared to the control group under the predator-absent condition, while the high-frequency, short-duration inspection behaviours remained the same as in the starved group.

On coral reefs, increases in heat-tolerant symbionts after thermal bleaching can reduce coral susceptibility to future stress. However, the relevance of this adaptive response is equivocal owing to conflicting reports of symbiont stability and change.We help reconcile this conflict by showing that change in symbiont community composition (symbiont shuffling) in Orbicella faveolata depends on the disturbance severity and recovery environment. The proportion of heat-tolerant symbionts dramatically increased following severe experimental bleaching, especially in a warmer recovery environment, but tended to decrease if bleaching was less severe. These patterns can be explained by variation in symbiont performance in the changing microenvironments created by differentially bleached host tissues. Furthermore, higher proportions of heat-tolerant symbionts linearly increased bleaching resistance but reduced photochemical efficiency, suggesting that any change in community structure oppositely impacts performance and stress tolerance. Therefore, even minor symbiont shuffling can adaptively benefit corals, although fitness effects of resulting trade-offs are difficult to predict.

Light to moderate infestations of hydrozoan polyps of a species in the genus Eutima were observed in the gills of oysters at all sites (prevalence 1% to 22%). Helminths included an unidentified turbellarian (prevalence 1% to 4%) observed at three sites and the digenetic trematodes Echinostoma sp., Proctoeces maculatus and Bucephalus sp. in oysters at five (prevalence 1% to 93%). three (prevalence >1%), and six (prevalence 1% to 3%) sites respectively. The first two trematodes were found infesting the gonoducts of their hosts while sporocysts of Bucephalus sp. infected connective tissues and gonads. Metacestodes of a species in the genus Tylocephalum were found in vesicular connective tissues near the gut, mantle, and in the gills of animals at all sites (prevalence 7% to 58%). Many sites had oysters with multiple infestations/infections of the above organisms indicating a rich biotic diversity, especially at those sites least impacted by human activity.","PT","include","interspecific","parasite-host",""

Biotic interactions have long been considered to be of less importance in structuring desert systems than other ecosystem types, but biotic interactions often play a critical role in meeting the challenges posed by the extreme conditions of desert environments. The Sonoran Desert, in particular, is home to several textbook examples of mutualisms, such as the interactions between the iconic saguaro cactus and its bat pollinators. But what do we know about the diversity, ecology, and evolution of plant-animal, plant-plant, and plant-microbe interactions and their impacts on individual plants and plant species in the Sonoran Desert? Methodology. To address this question, we review the published research on seven common kinds of plant biotic interactions by revisiting the respective literature, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and outlining future research directions. Pivotal results. Numerous gaps in our knowledge of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert were identified. Studies of insect herbivory, bee pollination, and plant-microbe interactions are poorly represented in the Sonoran Desert literature. Across all categories of interaction, few have examined the impacts of interactions on plant fitness or context-dependent variation in the outcomes and strengths of interactions. For the most part, interactions have been studied at single locations and over short periods of time, resulting in an incomplete understanding of their diversity, ecology, and evolution. Conclusions. Plant biotic interactions shape the habitats in which they occur and play an important role in the maintenance of species diversity. Therefore, we call for increased efforts to fill the gaps in our understanding of plant biotic interactions in the Sonoran Desert, with an emphasis on studies linking interactions to plant fitness and the context-dependent nature of interactions.

This process has been proposed to be a major evolutionary force, shaping many life history traits of species, and to govern global patterns of biodiversity at different scales. During range expansions selection may favor the evolution of higher dispersal, and symbiotic interactions may be affected. It has been argued that a weakness of climate fluctuation-driven range dynamics at equatorial latitudes has facilitated the persistence there of more specialized species and interactions. However, how much the biology and ecology of species is changed by range dynamics has seldom been investigated, particularly in equatorial regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied a three-species symbiosis endemic to coastal equatorial rainforests in Cameroon, where the impact of range dynamics is supposed to be limited, comprised of two species-specific obligate mutualists -an ant-plant and its protective ant- and a species-specific ant parasite of this mutualism. We combined analyses of within-species genetic diversity and of phenotypic variation in a transect at the southern range limit of this ant-plant system. All three species present congruent genetic signatures of recent gradual southward expansion, a result compatible with available regional paleoclimatic data. As predicted, this expansion has been accompanied by the evolution of more dispersive traits in the two ant species. In contrast, we detected no evidence of change in lifetime reproductive strategy in the tree, nor in its investment in food resources provided to its symbiotic ants. Conclusions/Significance: Despite the decreasing investment in protective workers and the increasing investment in dispersing females by both the mutualistic and the parasitic ant species, there was no evidence of destabilization of the symbiosis at the colonization front.

To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs.

Long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus (L.), live in family flocks during winter. Foraging, roosting and territory defence are done in groups. Communal roosting facilitates direct body contact among flock members, which may enhance the transmission of feather mites. Feather mites abundance was more similar within than among flocks; Within flocks, those individuals with longer wings and better body condition as determined by fat scores had larger numbers of feather mites.

Despite billions of years of cooperative coevolution  in what is arguably the most important mutualism in the history of life  the persistence of mitochondrial genomes also creates conditions for genetic conflict with the nucleus. Because mitochondrial genomes are present in numerous copies per cell, they are subject to both within- and among-organism levels of selection. Accordingly, selfish genotypes that increase their own proliferation can rise to high frequencies even if they decrease organismal fitness. It has been argued that uniparental (often maternal) inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes evolved to curtail such selfish replication by minimizing within-individual variation and, hence, within-individual selection.

Sperm competition, whereby sperm from multiple males compete to fertilize an egg, selects for adaptations that increase fertilization success. Because fertilization success is related to sperm number, size, and quality, both interspecific and intraspecific variation in these traits are predicted to correlate with the level of sperm competition. Specifically, species and individuals that experience high sperm competition are predicted to produce more sperm per ejaculate, produce longer sperm, and exert higher quality control, resulting in reduced numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm and reduced size variation via selection for the most successful sperm phenotype. However, the causes of sperm morphological and size variation and its consequences for sperm competition remain poorly understood, especially within species. We quantified variation in sperm morphology, size, and number in the Lancetailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata), a Neotropical suboscine passerine with a cooperative lek mating system. Although alpha-status males sire almost all chicks, the numbers of sperm produced per ejaculate by betas, nonterritorial adults, and subadult males were similar to those produced by alphas. Sperm counts declined with age in alphas, which may explain the decreased siring success of older alphas. Most ejaculates contained both normal helical sperm and abnormal sperm with rounded heads. The proportion of morphologically normal sperm per ejaculate was unrelated to social status or age. The coefficients of variation in sperm component length (head, tail, and total) both between and within alpha males were comparable to variation reported in passerines with low sperm competition. Total sperm length was shorter than in the majority of avian species studied to date, and cloacal protuberance and relative testis size were small. These results indicate low sperm competition, despite evidence for multiple paternity, or that sperm number rather than sperm morphology may be a major postcopulatory mediator of male reproductive success in this species. This work represents the first thorough quantification of intraspecific sperm variability in a suboscine passerine. Copyright 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.

Surprisingly, despite low levels of extra-pair paternity, CP size of non-breeding and pre-breeding males was positively correlated with the number of breeding females in the population, suggesting that CP size is sensitive to extra-pair mating opportunities. However, CP sizes do not seem to reflect cuckoldry risk: CP size of dominant males was unaffected by the presence of a subordinate that was unrelated to the dominant female, although those subordinates occasionally sire offspring, and had a larger CP than subordinates living with their mother.

For example, they may reflect differences in host physiology such as ventilation rate and generalized responses to expelling objects from their gills. Therefore, while bitterling are well adapted for their obligate spawning relationship with mussels, it has been much more difficult to find evidence for adaptations by mussels for dealing with bitterling.

"317","MA384","The origins of consistent individual differences in cooperation in wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo","Individual differences in contributions to cooperation can be strikingly consistent over time giving rise to alternative cooperative phenotypes within animal societies. Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as `breeders' and `nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and `escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes.

Three carapace measurements were taken for each specimen: carapace width (CW), carapace length (CL), and interocular distance (ID). The variables CL and ID were fit to a power equation taking CW as the reference dimension. As in other brachyurans, growth pattern analyses indicated an isometric type in all CW vs CL and CW vs ID relationships examined. Interspecific differences included a larger body size for T. bidentata and larger ID/CW for T. digitalis. Significant intraspecific differences in the two insular populations of T. digitalis were evidenced in the ID/CW ratio. In contrast, populations of T. bidentata were morphometrically closer. These results indicate a higher degree of connectedness of the parts of the T. bidentata metapopulation than of that of T. digitalis, probably due to differences in the duration of their larval stages. We think that the larger body size in T. bidentata might account for competitive advantages in food gathering and habitat selection over the remaining species. In turn, as a counteracting trait for its smaller size, the larger ID might allow T. digitalis a better ability to perceive 3D and to judge relative distances between objects, thus avoiding competitive combats and improving antipredatory or escape responses.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","KJB","exclude","","","","Carapace relative growth of Trapezia Latreille, 1828 (Decapoda, Brachyura), crabs that are symbionts of hard corals, from Clipperton atoll and the Revillagigedo islands: Ecological and zoogeographical implications","Decapod metapopulation dynamics are better understood by confronting theoretical studies with empirical data.

A common approach employed to describe viral quasispecies is by means of the quasispecies equation (QE). However, a main criticism of QE is its lack of frequency-dependent selection. This can be overcome by an alternative formulation for the evolutionary dynamics: the replicator-mutator equation (RME). In turn, a problem with the RME is how to quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing individuals (the different viral variants that constitute the quasispecies). This provides a theoretical framework to estimate quantitatively the fitness landscape. Results. Using this novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping for describing a quasispecies we explore the population distributions of viral variants that emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population distribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B) to show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and recent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or facilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve both A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of cooperation is the Shannon entropy. Conclusions. In order to get a typical quasispecies profile, at least within the considered mathematical approach, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Some dose of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several biological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms operating in quasispecies dynamics and to understand the quasispecies as a whole entity.  2010 Arbiza et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","CF","exclude","","","","Viral quasispecies profiles as the result of the interplay of competition and cooperation","Background.

We hypothesised that establishing or avoiding contact with edible yeast (host fungus) and inedible, toxic mould (non-host fungus) is regulated by fungus-specific variation in volatile production. In particular, we expected the non-host fungus to produce specific volatiles that repel fly larvae and thus contribute to signal inedibility. By quantifying innate variation in arrival of individual D. melanogaster larvae at colonies of the mutualist yeast Candida californica or of the antagonistic mould Penicillium expansum, we found the yeast to attract more rapidly a larger number of larvae than the mould did. The developmental stage (young, vegetative vs. old, sporulating) of P. expansum did not affect arrival of larvae at fungal colonies. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the composition of fungal volatiles. Four compounds appeared to be yeast-specific, twenty to be mould-specific volatiles.

Since wMelPop Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability.

We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number.

Highly coevolved nutritional mutualists do this by synthesizing nutrients missing from the host's diet. Genomics tools have advanced the study of these partnerships. Here we examined the endosymbiont Xiphinematobacter (phylum Verrucomicrobia) from the dagger nematode Xiphinema americanum, a migratory ectoparasite of numerous crops that also vectors nepovirus. Previously, this endosymbiont was identified in the gut, ovaries, and eggs, but its role was unknown. We explored the potential role of this symbiont using fluorescence in situ hybridization, genome sequencing, and comparative functional genomics. We report the first genome of an intracellular Verrucomicrobium and the first exclusively intracellular non-Woibachia nematode symbiont. Results revealed that Xiphinematobacter had a small 0.916-Mb genome with only 817 predicted proteins, resembling genomes of other mutualist endosymbionts. Compared with free-living relatives, conserved proteins were shorter on average, and there was large-scale loss of regulatory pathways. Despite massive gene loss, more genes were retained for biosynthesis of amino acids predicted to be essential to the host. Gene ontology enrichment tests showed enrichment for biosynthesis of arginine, histidine, and aromatic amino acids, as well as thiamine and coenzyme A, diverging from the profiles of relatives Akkermansia muciniphilia (in the human colon), Methylacidiphilum infemorum, and the mutualist Wolbachia from filarial nematodes. Together, these features and the location in the gut suggest that Xiphinematobacter functions as a nutritional mutualist, supplementing essential nutrients that are depleted in the nematode diet. This pattern points to evolutionary convergence with endosymbionts found in sap-feeding insects.","JW","exclude","","","","Comparative Genomics of a Plant-Parasitic Nematode Endosymbiont Suggest a Role in Nutritional Symbiosis","Bacterial mutualists can modulate the biochemical capacity of animals.

"369","MA60","Competing for seed dispersal: evidence for the role of avian seed hoarders in mediating apparent predation among oaks","
In communities of large-seeded tree species, generalist seed hoarders often link the temporally variable dynamics of various species in ways that can result in indirect ecological interactions. A special case of such interactions is apparent predation' - when variation in seed production of one tree species changes the outcome of the interaction between seed hoarders and another tree species from seed dispersal mutualism to predation. We investigated how two species of avian hoarders responded to differences in acorn availability among individual valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and across a landscape dominated by blue oaks (Q.douglasii) to determine whether seed dispersal and predation dynamics result in apparent predation between these oak species. California scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica), high-quality seed dispersers with large spatial scales of resource perception, showed strong numerical and functional responses to individually large Q.lobata acorn crops when landscape-level acorn crops were low, but the numerical response was not observed when Q.douglasii produced a good acorn crop the subsequent year. In contrast, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), which are significant acorn predators, exhibited a consistent functional response to individual Q.lobata acorn crops independent of landscape-wide availability. Consequently, Q.lobata experienced increased predation and a near absence of high-quality seed dispersal when Q.douglasii acorns were abundant. Our results suggest that apparent predation among oak species can arise from contrasting responses of generalist seed predators and dispersers to acorn availability on different spatial scales. Thus, the spatial scale of resource perception, which can differ greatly among generalist seed hoarders, may provide a proximate mechanism underlying indirect, temporally variable ecological affects such as apparent predation among sympatric species of large-seeded trees.

"375","MA66","Complementarity in both plant and mycorrhizal fungal communities are not necessarily increased by diversity in the other,","Higher species diversity can improve community performance within a species guild when different species complement each other in their use of the available niche, such as through resource partitioning. However, species in one guild of organisms may act as resources for another such that the diversity in one guild alters the realized niche for species in another. Yet, it remains largely untested as to whether diversity in one guild of organisms influences species complementarity in another. The productivity and diversity in plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities can be positively associated with each other through their typically mutualistic exchange of resources. Here, we utilized these two interacting species guilds to determine whether greater diversity in one influences species complementarity in the other. This was performed by creating monocultures and a mixture of a grass, forb and legume in a full factorial design with monocultures and a mixture of four AM fungi. The presence of AM fungi reduced differences in the performance among plant species and greater diversity of fungi generally improved plant productivity over the average of the fungal monocultures. However, plant species complementarity was not greatest with a higher diversity of fungi and was only positive with a particular fungal monoculture. AM fungal abundance was not affected by plant diversity, but was greatly reduced in the grass monoculture compared to the other plant communities. Variation in fungal complementarity among plant communities was low overall and was little influenced by plant diversity.Synthesis. Using a model plant-mycorrhizal system, our results suggest that the composition rather than the diversity of species within one guild may be more influential in determining how species function within an associated species guild. However, our model system does not represent a broad gradient of diversity in either plant or fungal communities and only assesses the initial growth phase. Nonetheless, our results highlight that changes in species compositions in one species guild can affect the functioning of species diversity in another.","UE","exclude",""," ","","Complementarity in both plant and mycorrhizal fungal communities are not necessarily increased by diversity in the other","Higher species diversity can improve community performance within a species guild when different species complement each other in their use of the available niche, such as through resource partitioning.

On the other hand they may select both, average fruit size and its variation. We addressed this issue by analyzing the phenotypic selection exerted by the dispersers of Crataegus monogyna on the fruit and seed size of this species. Fruit and seed size were analyzed at two ontogenic plant stages: the initial size of seeds (and their fruits) as future individuals and the mean size of fruits and seeds produced by adult plants. Fruit diameter and its within-individual variation are the actual targets of selection for maternal fruit traits, negatively affecting relative fitness, although total selection acts only on mean fruit size. For individual seeds, size selection is positive and directed at fruit diameter and seed length, while the remaining traits are subject to indirect selection. Birds exerted a correlational selection favoring big fruits with small seeds. Nevertheless the evolutionary consequences of this selection are expected to be limited by several factors. For example, the positive correlation between fruit and seed sizes, the existence of counteracting selective pressures exerted by other mutualistic or antagonist interactions and temporal or spatial changes in the environmental conditions that may alter the selective forces and even the optimum phenotype in each situation.","CM","exclude","","",NA,"Do seed-dispersing birds exert selection on optimal plant trait combinations?
