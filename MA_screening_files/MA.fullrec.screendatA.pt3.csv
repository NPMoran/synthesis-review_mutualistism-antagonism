Choosing a more environmentally-friendly livestock product in a diet can mitigate environmental impact. The objective of this research was to compare assessments of the environmental impact of livestock products. Twenty-five peer-reviewed studies were found that assessed the impact of production of pork, chicken, beef, milk, and eggs using life cycle analysis (LCA). Only 16 of these studies were reviewed, based on five criteria: study from an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) country, non-organic production, type of LCA methodology, allocation method used, and definition of system boundary. LCA results of these 16 studies were expressed in three ways: per kg product, per kg protein, and per kg of average daily intake of each product for an OECD country. The review yielded a consistent ranging of results for use of land and energy, and for climate change. No clear pattern was found, however, for eutrophication and acidification. Production of 1 kg of beef used most land and energy, and had highest global warming potential (GWP), followed by production of 1 kg of pork, chicken, eggs, and milk. Differences in environmental impact among pork, chicken, and beef can be explained mainly by 3 factors: differences in feed efficiency, differences in enteric CH4 emission between monogastric animals and ruminants, and differences in reproduction rates. The impact of production of 1 kg of meat (pork, chicken, beef) was high compared with production of 1 kg of milk and eggs because of the relatively high water content of milk and eggs. Production of 1 kg of beef protein also had the highest impact, followed by pork protein, whereas chicken protein had the lowest impact. This result also explained why consumption of beef was responsible for the largest part of the land use and GWP in an average OECD diet. This review did not show consistent differences in environmental impact per kg protein in milk, pork, chicken and eggs. Only one study compared environmental impact of meat versus milk and eggs. Conclusions regarding impact of pork or chicken versus impact of milk or eggs require additional comparative studies and further harmonization of LCA methodology. Interpretation of current LCA results for livestock products, moreover, is hindered because results do not include environmental consequences of competition for land between humans and animals, and consequences of land-use changes. We recommend, therefore, to include these consequences in future LCAs of livestock products.  2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1,"MA59","","","",""

The advantages of lateralization at the individual-level do not necessarily require that the entire population share the same pattern of lateralization. In fact, directional bias in lateralization may lead to behavioural predictability and enhanced predator success or prey evasion. Recent theory has suggested that population-level lateralization may be favored if individuals are better able to perform coordinated behaviours, providing a distinct advantage in cooperative contexts. Here we test whether the highly social, cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher shows lateralized responses to a social stimulus. We found population-level biases in males; on average male N. pulcher use their right eye/left hemisphere to view their mirror image. Individual females had a preferred hemisphere, but these preferences appeared not to be directionally aligned among females. We discuss these results in the context of coordinated social behaviour and suggest future research directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1,"MA229","","","",""

Protective traits may be induced upon exposure to predators or parasites. In a similar way, humans vaccinate in response to threatening epidemics. When most group members defend themselves, epidemics die out quickly because parasites cannot spread. A high level of group (herd) immunity is therefore beneficial to the group. There is, however, a well-known divergence between the optimum degree of induction for selfish individuals and the level of induction that maximizes group benefit. I develop two optimality models for the frequency of induction. The first model shows that higher relatedness favours more induction and a smaller difference between selfish and cooperative optima. The second model assumes variation in the vigour of individuals and therefore differences in the relative cost for induction. The model predicts that strong individuals induce more easily than weak individuals. Small differences in vigour cause a large divergence in the optimal levels of induction for strong and weak individuals. The concept of genetic relatedness in an evolutionary model is analogous to correlated interests and correlated strategies in an economic model of human behaviour. The evolutionary models presented here therefore provide a basis for further study of human vaccination.",2,"MA204","","","",""

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.",1,"MA113","","","",""

The model for gain of the individuals is based on the waiting times between subsequent prey encounters by the group. These waiting times depend on the number of foragers in the group. A single parameter of this dependency encompasses a variety of foraging scenarios, from cooperation to scramble. With constant patch size, correlations between gains of any pair of foragers are negative. This dependency is most intense in small groups. Increased variation in patch size makes correlations in gains between group members positive irrespective of the group size. For a solitary forager, variance in gain approaches zero with increasing time in the patch. For an individual member in a group, variance grows monotonically. Thus, depending on the patch departure rule controlling the time to be spent in the patch, solitary foragers may have a smaller variance in gain than members in a group. As solitary foragers also potentially harvest all prey in the patch, it is hard to believe that grouping behavior would evolve solely on the basis of foraging.",2,"MA61","","","",""

In theory, hosts should use flexible recognition rules that maximize the likelihood of rejecting cuckoo nestlings while minimizing the risk of rejecting their own young. Our previous work revealed that female superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus often abandoned nestling cuckoos and that the presence of a single chick in the nest was 1 trigger for abandonment because fairy-wrens also sometimes abandoned a single fairy-wren chick. Here we use a combination of 20 years of observational data, a cross-fostering experiment, and a brood size reduction experiment to determine the basis for individual variability in the chick-rejection rules of superb fairy-wrens in response to parasitism by Horsfield's bronze-cuckoos Chalcites basalis. We show that the decision to abandon a single chick is based on integration of learned recognition cues and external cues. Experienced females were relatively more likely to abandon a single cuckoo chick and accept a single fairy-wren chick than naive females. Breeding experience therefore facilitates the ability to make an accurate rejection decision, perhaps through learned refinement of the recognition template. In addition, fairy-wrens modified their rejection threshold in relation to the presence of adult cuckoos in the population, becoming more likely to abandon single nestlings with increasing risk of parasitism. By using these flexible rejection rules, female superb fairy-wrens are more likely to defend themselves successfully against exploitation by the cuckoo and are less prone to mistakenly reject their own offspring.",1,"MA150","","","",""

The basis of the antiinfective selectivity of these compounds is clear; the antifolates trimethoprim and pyrimethamine are potent inhibitors of bacterial and protozoal DHFRs, respectively, but are only weak inhibitors of mammalian DHFRs. These species-selective agents apparently exploit the differences in the active site regions of the parasite and host enzymes. Methotrexate is the DHFR inhibitor used most often in a clinical setting as an anticancer drug and as an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agent.

This phenotypic response suggests the ability to assess the genetic relatedness of conspecific competitors, proposing kin selection as a process that can influence plant competitive interactions. Kin selection can favour restrained competitive growth towards kin, if the fitness loss from reducing own growth is compensated by increased fitness in the related neighbour. This may lead to positive frequency dependency among related conspecifics with important ecological consequences for species assemblage and coexistence. However, kin selection in plants is still controversial. First, many studies documenting a plastic response to neighbour relatedness do not estimate fitness consequences of the individual that responds, and when estimated, fitness of individuals grown in competition with kin did not necessarily exceed that of individuals grown in non-kin groups. Although higher fitness in kin groups could be consistent with kin selection, this could also arise from mechanisms like asymmetric competition in the non-kin groups. Here we outline the main challenges for studying kin selection in plants taking genetic variation for competitive ability into account. We emphasize the need to measure inclusive fitness in order to assess whether kin selection occurs, and show under which circumstances kin selected responses can be expected. We also illustrate why direct fitness estimates of a focal plant, and group fitness estimates are not suitable for documenting kin selection. Importantly, natural selection occurs at the individual level and it is the inclusive fitness of an individual plant - not the mean fitness of the group - that can capture if a differential response to neighbour relatedness is favoured by kin selection.",1,"MA194","","","",""

The huge diversity of symbiotic associations among animals and/or plants comprises both mutualisms and parasitisms. Most symbioses between social insect species, however, involve social parasites, while mutual benefits have been only suspected for some parabiotic associations - two colonies that share a nest. 2. In the rainforest of Borneo, we studied parabiotic associations between the ants Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur. Parabiotic nests were regularly found inside hollow tree trunks, most likely initiated by Cr. modiglianii. This species frequently nested without its partner, whereas we never found non-parabiotic Ca. rufifemur nests. We experimentally investigated potential benefits, potential interference competition for food (as a probable cost), and foraging niches of both species. 3. The two species never showed aggressive interactions and amicably shared food resources. However, Cr. modiglianii had a wider temporal and spatial foraging range than Ca. rufifemur, always found baits before Ca. rufifemur and recruited more efficiently. Camponotus rufifemur probably benefited from following pheromone trails of Cr. modiglianii. In turn, Ca. rufifemur was significantly more successful in defending the nest against alien ants. Crematogaster modiglianii hence may profit from its partner's defensive abilities. 4. In neotropical parabioses, epiphytes grown in 'ant-gardens' play a crucial role in the association, e.g. by stabilization of nests. Hemiepiphytic Poikilospermum cordifolium (Cecropiaceae) seedlings and saplings frequently grew in the entrances of parabiotic nests in Borneo, obviously dispersed by the ants. In cafeteria experiments, both parabiotic ants carried its elaiosome-bearing seeds into the nest. However, P. cordifolium does not provide additional nest space, contrasting with neotropical ant-gardens. 5. The parabiotic association appears beneficial for both ant species, the main benefits being nest initiation by Cr. modiglianii and interspecific trail-following (for Ca. rufifemur), and, in turn, nest defence by Ca. rufifemur (for Cr. modiglianii). However, Ca. rufifemur seems to be more dependent on its partner than vice versa.  2009 British Ecological Society.",2,"MA267","","","",""

Various host traits may differently influence host accessibility and within-host population growth of each symbiont species, or they may determine the outcome of within-host interactions among coexisting species. In turn, phenotypic diversity of a host species may promote divergent exploitation strategies among its symbiotic organisms. We studied the distribution of two feather mite species, Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata, among blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla wintering in southern Spain during six winters. The host population included migratory and sedentary individuals, which were unequally distributed between two habitat types (forests and shrublands). Visual mite counts showed that both mite species often coexisted on sedentary blackcaps, but were seldom found together on migratory blackcaps. Regardless of host habitat, Proctophyllodes were highly abundant and Trouessartia were scarce on migratory blackcaps, but the abundance of both mite species converged in intermediate levels on sedentary blackcaps. Coexistence may come at a cost for Proctophyllodes, whose load decreased when Trouessartia was present on the host (the opposite was not true). Proctophyllodes load was positively correlated with host wing length (wings were longer in migratory blackcaps), while Trouessartia load was positively correlated to uropygial gland size (sedentary blackcaps had bigger glands), which might render migratory and sedentary blackcaps better hosts for Proctophyllodes and Trouessartia, respectively. Our results draw a complex scenario for mite co-existence in the same host species, where different mite species apparently take advantage of, or are constrained by, divergent host phenotypic traits.

The founder group fissioned four times within 3.5 years after transfer to the enclosure, indicating that external factors-new environment, more space, absence of other groups-facilitated group fissions. Two groups resulting from these fissions, split twice within 2.5 and 1 years, respectively, many years later. The process of fissioning lasted from a few months to almost 2 years. Fissions were preceded by peripheralization/subgrouping of mainly young adult males (8-10 years old), suggesting that male competition was the primary force for the fissions. The males were joined by middle- to low-ranking but not the lowest-ranking females. The resulting new groups were usually smaller than the groups in which the former -matriline-old groups-stayed, and they were also more variable in size and sex ratio, suggesting that variable numbers of surplus individuals were expelled during fission. Mean adult sex ratios were similar in both groups after fission, indicating that the competitively superior males in the old groups (groups + -matriline) could not increase their breeding opportunities. Female kin, even of large matrilinies, almost always stayed together during fission. Natal males strongly preferred to join the old groups, and this preference was most pronounced in juveniles and subadults. Hence, most natal males stayed with maternally related females, i.e., remained true natal males, if the females stayed in old groups. They were separated from female kin, i.e., became seminatal, if the females joined the new groups. These seminatal males did not differ from natal males with respect to matrilineal rank; but they had more female relatives, above all more close relatives (sisters), indicating that avoidance of mating with maternal kin was important for group choice. Despite joining the same group as female kin during fissioning breeding opportunities of natal males (ratio of unrelated females/male) were not less than that of their seminatal peers, because natal males had fewer female relatives. Only a minority of both groups of males would have done better by joining the alternative group. Paternal relatives were distributed during fission by chance, and loss of patrilinies was therefore much less pronounced. We conclude that the rules governing social relationships among Barbary macaque males are less apt to cope with the high number of males resulting from provisioning; whereas the rules regulating social relationships of females living in a nepotistic, female-bonded society are very robust in this respect.",2,"MA170","","","",""

To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.",1,"MA363","","","",""

Selection at the level of individual sperm has been suggested to explain the evolution of two enigmatic sperm phenotypes: sperm heteromorphism, where more than one type of sperm is produced by a male, and sperm conjugation, where multiple sperm join together for motility and transport through the female reproductive tract before dissociation prior to fertilization. In sperm heteromorphic species, only one of the sperm morphs typically participates in fertilization, with the non-fertilizing ""parasperm"" being interpreted as reproductive altruists. Likewise, in species with sperm conjugation, high levels of sperm mortality have been suggested to be required for conjugate break-up and this has been considered evidence of kin-selected altruism. However, it is unclear if sperm possess the heritable variation in fitness (i.e. are individuals) required for the evolution of cooperation. We investigate the question of sperm individuality by focusing on how sperm morphology is determined and how sperm conjugates are formed. Concentrating on sperm conjugation, we discuss functional hypotheses for the evolutionary maintenance of this remarkable trait. Additionally, we speculate on the potential origins of sperm heteromorphism and conjugation, and explore the diversification and losses of these traits once they have arisen in a lineage. We find current evidence insufficient to support the concept of sperm control over their form or function. Thus, without additional evidence of haploid selection (i.e. sperm phenotypes that reflect their haploid genome and result in heritable differences in fitness), sperm heteromorphism and conjugation should be interpreted not as cooperation but rather as traits selected at the level of the male, much like other ejaculatory traits such as accessory gland proteins and ejaculate size.  2010 The Authors.

In a number of species, female group members are significantly smaller than males, so the costs associated with intergroup aggression outweigh the potential benefits and females avoid participating. Studies conducted on species in which females are active participants have consistently found that they fight to defend access to food resources and that high-ranking females tend to be more active than low-rankers. However, additional factors may modulate the costs and benefits of participation, creating differences between individuals and variability within individuals over time. In this study, we investigated costs and benefits that potentially affect female vervet monkey, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, participation in intergroup conflicts. We observed the participation of 35 females in three groups, during 115 intergroup conflicts. Our findings suggest that female vervet monkeys defend access to valuable food resources, as well as to areas that are intensely used in the long term; however, rank also influenced female participation indicating that the potential benefits gained from resource defence vary with one's priority of access to these resources. We found that females were more likely to participate aggressively when they did not have an infant, and when they received more male support throughout the intergroup conflict, suggesting these factors influence the perceived risk, or costs, of intergroup aggression. Because we observed considerable temporal variability in both the proportion of female group members with infants and the number and identity of male group members (i.e. amount of male support provided), the relative fighting ability of neighbouring groups will inevitably fluctuate. Thus, our findings may help explain the lack of stable intergroup dominance relationships observed in many studies of intergroup conflict. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner's songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of barred antshrikes, Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects' behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding.

Data on sex-specific behavior in monomorphic taxa are needed to test theories of reproductive investment. It has been suggested that in seabirds foraging niche separation may be related to decreased intersexual competition for food between cooperating pair-bonded individuals. Alternatively, sex differences in foraging niches may be driven by different nutritional requirements of females associated with the reproductive costs of egg production and oviposition. To assess these possibilities, we studied a size-monomorphic colonial seabird, the Australasian Gannet (Morus serrator) at the Cape Kidnappers gannetry, New Zealand. We recorded maximum dive depths, and distinct diet composition of incubating females as indicated by stable isotopic signatures. Results suggested greater female foraging effort during early times of incubation, indicated by significantly deeper maximum dives. Sex-specific foraging patterns across other breeding stages were more variable. Nitrogen stable isotopic values showed that incubating females occupied a different trophic position compared to males at the same breeding stage, and also from those of gannets of both sexes at later stages of parental care. Overall, the data are consistent with cost-of-oviposition compensation in females necessitating male-bias in parental care in biparental breeders.

Here we suggest that the building blocks of social cognition are a suite of skills, ordered roughly according to the cognitive demands they place upon individuals. These skills allow an animal to recognize others by various means; to recognize and remember other animals' relationships; and, perhaps, to attribute mental states to them. Some skills are elementary and virtually ubiquitous in the animal kingdom; others are more limited in their taxonomic distribution. We treat these skills as the targets of selection, and assume that more complex levels of social cognition evolve only when simpler methods are inadequate. As a result, more complex levels of social cognition indicate greater selective pressures in the past. The presence of each skill can be tested directly through field observations and experiments. In addition, the same methods that have been used to compare social cognition across species can also be used to measure individual differences within species and to test the hypothesis that individual differences in social cognition are linked to differences in reproductive success.

The rather insecure theory in the bryophyte literature was distilled into eight quantifiable predictions, which were tested. For seven, there was no sign of the predicted differences: i.e. no indication of the predicted low within-community heterogeneity, higher species richness, more variable species richness, lower rank consistency, a poor fit for the geometric model of RAD (relative abundance distribution), better fit for the broken-stick and general-lognormal RAD models with general-lognormal parameter gamma deviating further from 1.0, or of a good fit for the Zipf-Mandelbrot RAD model. However, evenness was, on average, significantly (p=0.005) less in the bryophyte communities, using any of four evenness indices. Two possible features of bryophytes are suggested that might cause this: (a) a smaller module (i.e. shoot, leaf) size, allowing species to be present with a lower threshold biomass, and (b) less efficient competitive exclusion among bryophytes because of weaker competition and a predominance of mutualism, as suggested in the literature.

Such coordination, however, often occurs selectively, and the contextual information animals use to determine when they coordinate and when they do not is unclear. We investigate this issue in the highly territorial downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens) by exploring how individuals within a social breeding pair differentially modulate coordinated aggressive responses during graded simulated territorial intrusions (STIs). Analyses show that resident pairs mount a more robust aggressive response to STIs that represent a greater threat. Moreover, in this social context, pair members produce contact vocalizations in a way that predicts their partners aggressive behavior. We also show that, when presented with a low threat, individuals that first respond to intrusions decrease their aggressive output once their partner attends to the stimulus; the partner, in turn, increases their levels of aggressive behavior. This does not occur in high-threat STIs, where both partners maintain high levels of aggression throughout the entire encounter. Together, these results show that individuals within a pair flexibly adjust their aggressive tactics in response to different social competitive contexts, and this includes adjusting the way in which individuals coordinate certain aspects of their agonistic repertoire. We speculate that this ability reflects an adaptive mechanism that allows individuals to fine-tune territorial tactics to reduce overall costs of aggression. Significance statement: Although research has demonstrated that individuals often coordinate their behavior to accomplish common tasks, little is known about the factors that determine when such coordination occurs and when it does not. We address this issue for the first time in the highly territorial downy woodpecker by testing how the level of threat associated with a territorial interaction influences the coordination of defensive behavior. We find that, when facing intruders that pose a greater threat, residents adjust levels of aggressive output in response to the number of vocalizations produced by their breeding partner. By contrast, this relationship is not observed when pairs face intruders that pose a relatively lower threat. Our data therefore provide striking evidence that coordination in defensive tactics depends on the residents appraisal of the social context, such that fiercer competition is associated with greater behavioral coordination.  2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2,"MA386","","","",""

For example, sex differences in preferred foraging techniques used by green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, have previously been explained by sexual dimorphism in bill length and the benefits afforded by foraging specialization and niche differentiation within cooperative groups. Contrary to this argument, there were no sex differences in mean foraging success and/or prey size captured when males and females used the same foraging techniques. Subordinates of both sexes did experience lower and more varied foraging success compared with dominants, but probably only as a consequence of competition or inexperience. However, dominant males experienced greater variance in individual foraging success compared with dominant females, and dominant males also experienced greater variances in prey size when using their preferred foraging techniques. Dominant males therefore appeared to specialize in foraging techniques that provided more variable rewards, whilst dominant females consistently chose to minimize variation in reward. Dominant females also experienced less variance in foraging returns when using the same techniques as males, suggesting a possible link with sexual dimorphism in bill length. Partitioning of foraging niches in dominant green woodhoopoes therefore appears to be better explained by sex differences in variance (risk) sensitivity to foraging rewards. We suggest that this kind of detailed analysis of state-dependent foraging has the potential to explain many of the crucial age and sex differences in behaviour within cooperative groups.  2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",2,"MA402","","","",""

The behavioural phenotype of a conspecific is likely to affect the outcome of a social interaction, so an individual must be able to accurately assess behavioural phenotypes in order to optimize behavioural responses during mate choice, cooperative relationships and agonistic interactions. However, behavioural assessment based on dyadic interactions in different contexts can be costly because it may require significant time, increase the risk of predation and often necessitates special cognitive abilities. Different colour cues are associated with different life history strategies in many species, so coloration might also correlate with behavioural phenotype. Thus, conspecifics could use coloration as a single cue for the mediation of social interactions. We investigated the relationship between personality and coloration in the monogamous, biparental convict cichlid. This species has black melanin-based stripes with interindividual variation in the intensity of these stripes. In addition, females have bright orange spots on their abdomens. Using repeatable measures of boldness, exploration and aggressiveness, we were able to define a behavioural syndrome and quantified the behavioural type of each individual. Behavioural types were predicted by colour traits. In particular, proactive individuals (more aggressive, bolder and quicker to resume behaviour after being startled) were more likely to be dark and, among females, have smaller orange areas. Our results support the hypothesis that coloration in the convict cichlid is related to personality. Thus, coloration could play an important role in mediating social interactions, allowing a quick and reliable assessment of conspecifics' behavioural types.

Yet, the ecological drivers of this small-scale heterogeneity of interaction patterns and their outcomes remain virtually unexplored. We analyzed spatial structure in the frequency and intensity of interactions that vertebrate pollinators (birds and lizards) and invertebrate antagonists (florivores, nectar larcenists, and seed predators) had when interacting with the insular plant Isoplexis canariensis, and their effect on plant fitness. Spatially autocorrelated variation in plant reproductive success (fruit and viable seed set) emerged from the combined action of mutualists and antagonists, rather than reflecting the spatial pattern of any specific animal group. However, the influence of antagonists on plant fitness was stronger primarily due to the florivores' action on earlier reproductive stages, consuming and damaging floral structures before the arrival of pollinators. Our results indicate that the early action of antagonists creates hotspots of increased plant damage, where the effects of later acting mutualists are not translated into increased reproductive benefits. We foresee the potential for antagonists to shape the intra-population mosaics of plant fitness in situations where antagonists outnumber mutualists, when their interactions occur before those of mutualists, and when mutualists can detect and avoid damaged plants while foraging. Severely damaged plants in antagonistic hotspots might be excluded from the mating network and render a limited production of viable seeds, reducing both the growth rate of the plant population and the effective population size.",1,"MA187","","","",""

It is hypothesized that intraspecific variation in plant chemical resistance, in which individuals of a host-plant population exhibit genetic differences in their chemical contents (called plant chemotypes), may be an important determinant of variation in food web structure and functioning. We evaluated this hypothesis using field assessments and plant chemical assays in the tansy plant Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae). We examined food webs in which chemotypes of tansy plants are the resource for two specialized aphids, their predators and mutualistic ants. The density of the ant-tended aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride was significantly higher on particular chemotypes (borneol) than others. Clear chemotype preferences between predators were also detected. Aphid specialist seven-spotted ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata) were more often found on camphor plants, while significantly higher numbers of the polyphagous nursery web spider (Pisaura mirabilis) were observed on borneol plants.

Calling upon observations from experiments, we draw attention to proto-life cycles that emerge via unconventional routes and that transition, in single steps, individuality to higher levels. One such life cycle arises from conflicts among levels of selection and invokes cheats as a primitive germ line: it lays the foundation for collective reproduction, the basis of a self-policing system, the selective environment for the emergence of development, and hints at a plausible origin for a soma/germ line distinction.",1,"MA43","","","",""

It has been suggested that symbiotic inhabitants have a lower rate of genetic change compared to exhabitants because the latter are more exposed to abiotic environmental variation and competition from other organisms. In order to test this hypothesis we compared substitution rates in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) among fungal species with rates among their respective algal symbionts. To ensure valid comparisons, only taxon pairs (12) with a common evolutionary history were used. On average, substitution rates in the ITS1 portion of Omphalina pairs were 27.5 times higher than rates in the corresponding pairs of Coccomyxa since divergence from their respective ancestor at the base of the Omphalina/Coccomyxa lineage. Substitution rates in the 5.8S and the ITS2 portions were 2.4 and 18.0 times higher, respectively. The highest rate difference (43.0) was found in the ITS1 region. These are, to our knowledge, the highest differences of substitution rates reported for symbiotic organisms. We conclude that the Omphalina model system conforms to the proposed hypothesis of lower substitution rates in the inhabitant, but that the mode of transmission of the inhabitant (vertical versus horizontal) could be a prevailing factor in the regulation of unequal rates of nucleotide substitution between co-evolving symbionts. Our phylogenetic study of Coccomyxa revealed three main lineages within this genus, corresponding to free-living :Coccomyxa, individuals isolated from basidiolichens Omphalina and Coccomyxa isolated from ascolichens belonging to the Peltigerales.

Blood-feeding parasites feed on a diet that is nutritionally unbalanced and thus often rely on symbionts to supplement essential nutrients. However, they are also of medical importance as they can be infected by pathogens such as bacteria, protists or viruses that take advantage of the blood-feeding nutritional strategy for own transmission. Since blood-feeding evolved multiple times independently in diverse animals, it showcases a gradient of host-microbe interactions. While some parasitic lineages are possibly asymbiotic and manage to supplement their diet from other food sources, other lineages are either loosely associated with extracellular gut symbionts or harbour intracellular obligate symbionts that are essential for the host development and reproduction. What is perhaps even more diverse are the pathogenic lineages that infect blood-feeding parasites. This microbial diversity not only puts the host into a complicated situation -distinguishing between microorganisms that can greatly decrease or increase its fitness -but also increases opportunity for horizontal gene transfer to occur in this environment.

Thus, it is likely that the interactions among plants, mutualists, and other selective agents, such as antagonists, ultimately shape the evolution of floral and flowering traits. We examined the importance of pollination vs pre-dispersal seed predation to selection on plant and floral characters via female plant-reproductive success in Castilleja linariaefolia (Scrophulariaceae). C. linariaefolia is pollinated by hummingbirds and experiences high levels of pre-dispersal seed predation by plume moth and fly larvae in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, where this work was conducted. We first examined whether female reproduction in C. linariaefolia was limited by pollination. Supplemental pollination only marginally increased components of female reproduction, likely because seed predation masked, in part, the beneficial effects of pollen addition. In unmanipulated populations, we measured calyx length, flower production, and plant height and used path analysis combined with structural equation modeling to quantify their importance to relative seed set through pathways involving pollination vs seed predation. We found that the strength of selection on calyx length, flower production, and plant height was greater for seed predation pathways than for pollination pathways, and one character, calyx length, experienced opposing selection via pollination vs seed predation. These results suggest that the remarkable intraspecific variation in plant and floral characters exhibited by some flowering plants is likely the result of selection driven, at least in part, by pollinators in concert with antagonists, such as pre-dispersal seed predators.

Acoustic signals in birds provide the potential to encode individual-specific information. We examined the degree to which individual identity, sex, breeding status, group membership and genetic relatedness were related to variability in six different call types, which occurred across a variety of different behavioural contexts in the apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea, a socially living and cooperatively breeding Australian passerine.

Mathematical models typically find that such conflict can be resolved by partial-response strategies, leading investors to contribute relatively equitably. Using a case study approach, we show that such model expectations can be contradicted in at least four disparate contexts: (i) bi-parental care; (ii) cooperative breeding; (iii) cooperative hunting; and (iv) human cooperation. We highlight that: (a) marked variation in contributions is commonplace; and (b) individuals can often respond positively rather than negatively to the contributions of others. Existing models have surprisingly limited power in explaining these phenomena. Here, we propose that, although among-individual variation in cooperative contributions will be influenced by differential costs and benefits, there is likely to be a strong genetic or epigenetic component.

To understand the evolution of this diverse breeding system and frequent clutch desertion, we use 6 years of field data to derive fitness expectations for males and females depending on whether or not they care for their offspring. The resulting payoff matrix corresponds to an asymmetric Snowdrift Game with two alternative evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs): female-only and male-only care. This, however, does not explain the polymorphism in care strategies and frequent biparental desertion, because theory predicts that one of the two ESSs should have spread to fixation. Using a bootstrapping approach, we demonstrate that taking account of individual variation in payoffs explains the patterns of care better than a model based on the average population payoff matrix. In particular, a model incorporating differences in male attractiveness closely predicts the observed frequencies of male and female desertion.

Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of bio-diversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. 2. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. 3. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. 4. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator-prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore-plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant-pollinator systems). 5. Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.",1,"MA2","","","",""

Genetic analyses of the zooxanthellae were based on ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. In the GBR samples, Symbiodinium clades A and G were encountered with A and G being rare. Clade B zooxanthellae have been previously reported from a GBR octocoral, but are also rare in octocorals from this region. Symbiodinium G has so far only been found in Foraminifera, but is rare in these organisms. In the Caribbean samples, only Symbiodinium clades B and C are present. Hence, Symbiodinium diversity at the level of phylogenetic clades is lower in octocorals from the Caribbean compared to those from the GBR. However, an unprecedented level of ITS1 diversity was observed within individual colonies of some Caribbean gorgonians, implying either that these simultaneously harbour multiple strains of clade B zooxanthellae, or that ITS1 heterogeneity exists within the genomes of some zooxanthellae. Intracladal diversity based on ITS should therefore be interpreted with caution, especially in cases where no independent evidence exists to support distinctiveness, such as ecological distribution or physiological characteristics. All samples from EP are azooxanthellate. Three unrelated GBR taxa that are described in the literature as azooxanthellate (Junceella fragilis, Euplexaura nuttingi and Stereonephthya sp. 1) contain clade G zooxanthellae, and their symbiotic association with zooxanthellae was confirmed by histology. These corals are pale in colour, whereas related azooxanthellate species are brightly coloured. The evolutionary loss or gain of zooxanthellae may have altered the light sensitivity of the host tissues, requiring the animals to adopt or reduce pigmentation. Finally, we superimposed patterns of the octocoral-algal symbiosis onto a molecular phylogeny of the host. The data show that many losses/gains of endosymbiosis have occurred during the evolution of octocorals. The ancestral state (azooxanthellate or zooxanthellate) in octocorals remains unclear, but the data suggest that on an evolutionary timescale octocorals can switch more easily between mixotrophy and heterotrophy compared to scleractinian corals, which coincides with a low reliance on photosynthetic carbon gain in the former group of organisms.  2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",1,"MA96","","","",""

Field and laboratory observations showed that Chiricahua foundresses are primarily haplometrotic, whereas Sierra Ancha foundresses can be either haplometrotic or facultatively pleometrotic. Nestmate relatedness of mature Sierra Ancha field colonies suggests that the reproductive individuals within these colonies are unrelated, consistent with primary polygyny. In the laboratory, Sierra Ancha foundresses cooperatively established incipient colonies without queen reduction, and colonies with multiple queens produced more minims andworkers that may serve the role ofrepletes (honeypots) than haplometrotic colonies. This was in stark contrast to foundresses from the Chiricahua population, which showed strong aggression when forced to found colonies together in the laboratory. When brood raiding was experimentally induced between laboratory Sierra Ancha colonies, queens from colonies with more workers had a higher survival probability, although in some cases the competing colonies fused and queens from both colonies continued to reproduce.

Testosterone is theorized to influence status-seeking behaviors such as social dominance and competitive behavior, but supporting evidence is mixed. The present study tested the roles of testosterone and cortisol in the hawk dove game, a dyadic economic decision-making paradigm in which earnings depend on one's own and the other player's choices. If one person selects the hawk strategy and the other person selects the dove strategy, the player who selected hawk attains a greater financial pay-off (status differentiation). The worst financial outcome occurs when both players choose the hawk strategy (status confrontation). Ninety-eight undergraduate students (42 men) provided saliva samples and played ten rounds of the hawk-dove game with another same-sex participant. In support of the hypothesis that testosterone is related to status concern, individuals higher in basal testosterone made more hawk decisions decisions that harmed the other player. Acute decreases in cortisol were also associated with more hawk decisions. There was some empirical support for the dual-hormone hypothesis as well: basal testosterone was positively related to satisfaction in the game among low basal-cortisol individuals but not among high basal-cortisol individuals. There were no significant sex differences in these hormonal effects. The present findings align with theories of hormones and status-seeking behavior at the individual level, but they also open up new avenues for research on hormone profiles at the collective level. Our results suggest that the presence of two or more high-testosterone members increases the likelihood of status confrontations over a limited resource that can undermine collective outcomes.

Where groups compete as units, differences in group size might outweigh inter-individual differences in determining the outcome of contests. Given this species' variable social system, we predicted that the composition of groups would also influence their resource holding potential. Playback experiments showed that the number of simulated intruders significantly influenced the strength of response by defending groups hearing the stimulus: groups were less likely to approach but gave more protracted and more communal vocal responses as the number of vocalising intruders increased.

Furthermore, the ratio of adult males to females in the defending group significantly affected the probability of approach, with the probability increasing as groups became more male-biased. This finding supports the idea that the social structure of groups may be important in determining the outcome of contests between groups. Overall this study provides some indication in birds of relative numerical assessment based on vocal cues.",1,"MA55","","","",""

This fossil not only provides the oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi but also contains morphological features similar to asexual states of Hirsutella and Hymenostilbe of the extant genus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). Because species of Hypocreales collectively exhibit a broad range of nutritional modes and symbioses involving plants, animals and other fungi, we conducted ancestral host reconstruction coupled with phylogenetic dating analyses calibrated with P. coccophagus. These results support a plant-based ancestral nutritional mode for Hypocreales, which then diversified ecologically through a dynamic process of intra- and interkingdom host shifts involving fungal, higher plant and animal hosts. This is especially evident in the families Cordycipitaceae, Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae, which are characterized by a high occurrence of insect pathogens. The ancestral ecologies of Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae are inferred to be animal pathogens, a trait inherited from a common ancestor, whereas the ancestral host affiliation of Cordycipitaceae was not resolved. Phylogenetic dating supports both a Jurassic origin of fungal-animal symbioses within Hypocreales and parallel diversification of all three insect pathogenic families during the Cretaceous, concurrent with the diversification of insects and angiosperms.

The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",1,"MA284","","","",""

Identifying the ecological and environmental drivers of variation in the genetic composition and function of rhizobial communities is critical to understanding rhizobial impacts on community and ecosystem productivity. In this study, we examined how environmental factors and host species jointly affect rhizobial phenotypic diversity and community structure. Individual host plants of two native Australian legumes, Acacia salicina and A.stenophylla, were inoculated with a community of six rhizobial strains (belonging to three genera) previously characterized for symbiotic effectiveness. The plants were grown in a fully factorial experiment under high and low phosphorus and water, and high or no nitrogen. Half the plants were harvested after 19weeks and the other half after 30weeks. The relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was characterized using amplicon sequencing of the rhizobial 16S rRNA gene from DNA extracted from the root nodules of plants after each harvest. Variation in the relative abundance of the six rhizobial strains was best explained by host species, although interactions between environment and host species also emerged as significant predictors of variation in rhizobial community composition. We detected strong host-specific interactions for two strains, while two other strains were clearly generalists, being relatively abundant in both host species. For both host species, the two generalist strains were as abundant as the best specialist strain within the rhizobial community. Synthesis. Our study show host species identity as the key determinant of rhizobial community structure within the root nodules of Acacia plants. Strains that were efficient at promoting the growth of their host plant had high relative abundance in experimental communities. Furthermore, interaction among host species, rhizobial host-range, and environmental variation determine the structure of rhizobial communities, although not in clearly predictable ways. Such interactions contributed to the maintenance (albeit at relatively low frequencies) of ineffective strains in nodule communities. These interacting effects could help to explain why rhizobial communities are functionally diverse, such that specialists, generalists and seemingly ineffective rhizobia, can be simultaneously maintained in rhizosphere communities.  2016 The Authors.

Here we present a punisher/bystander approach rooted in inclusive fitness logic to predict which individuals should take on punishing roles in animal societies. We apply our scheme to societies of eusocial Hymenoptera and nonhuman vertebrate social breeders, and we outline potential extensions for understanding conflict regulation among cells in metazoan bodies and unrelated individuals in human societies. We highlight that: 1) no social unit is expected to express punishment behavior unless it collects positive inclusive fitness benefits that surpass alternative benefits of bystanding; 2) punishment with public good benefits can be maintained through either direct fitness benefits (coercion) or indirect fitness benefits (correction) or both; 3) differences across social systems in the distributions of power, relatedness, and reproductive options drive variation in the extent to which individuals actively punish; and 4) inclusive fitness logic captures many punishment-relevant evolutionary and ecological variables in a single framework that appears to apply across very different types of social arrangements.

The underlining cause for this is still unclear. Here we address this question by evolutionary stable strategy analysis and exact calculation of frequency-dependent selection and genetic drift in geographically structured populations. Reproductive investments of hermaphrodites are divided into male and female functions, and each sex requires linear investments that increase linearly with successful gamete number and reusable investments (RIs) that increase less than linearly. Individuals specializing into one sex require RIs of only this sex and thus can produce more gametes. However, these gametes suffer strong kin competition as they are of the same sex and gamete number of the other sex decreases. The success of individuals specializing into one sex requires individuals specializing into the other sex to cooperate with them, providing them with more opposite-sex gametes and relaxing them of the same-sex competition. The evolution of this cooperation does not require two rare mutations to happen simultaneously at the same place, because single-sex mutants can sparsely spread in a hermaphroditic population with RIs despite genetic drift and wait for mutants of the other sex to arise. RI resembles fixed cost in previous theories. However, previous theories considered all costs except for costs for gametes as fixed costs and this does not capture an important plant-animal difference; modular growth of sexual organs in most plants and some animals promotes reproductive investments to increase linearly with offspring number, so their investments in sexual organs are linear investments rather than fixed costs. This study shows the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites as an example of the evolution of cooperation and mutualism as in harmony games, and highlights modular growth as an important factor that prevents most plants and some animals from evolving into separate sexes.

Several aspects of sexual reproduction may be influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi including the timing of reproductive events, the number of inflorescences per plant, the number of flowers per inflorescence, the amount of pollen per flower, the proportion of flowers producing fruits, and the number of seeds per fruit. Seed quality can also be strongly influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi, resulting in variation in seedling vigor and resultant competitive ability.

In the study reported here, we observed aggressive interactions among three same-sex individuals in Julidochromis regani in the laboratory and tested whether inter-female aggression was more intense than inter-male aggression. Although difference in body size strongly determined the direction of aggression in fish, aggression by a smaller-sized individuals toward larger ones was occasionally observed. This type of aggression was common between individuals of a similar body size (<= 5 mm) and occurred more frequently among females than males. In contrast, differences in body size and sex did not affect the frequency of aggression by larger-sized individuals against smaller ones. Bidirectional aggression (i.e., mouth fighting) occurred frequently when two individuals had similar body size, and there was no difference in its frequency between sexes. However, temporal analysis showed that females performed bidirectional aggression more persistently than males.

While experiments have shown that cooperation can increase population size, cooperation and population size can become negatively correlated if spatial processes affect both variables in opposite directions. We use a simple mathematical model of spatial common-pool resource production to investigate how space affects the cooperation-population size relationship. We find that only cooperation that is sufficiently beneficial to neighbours increases population size. However, spatial clustering variations can create a negative cooperation-population relationship between populations even when cooperation is highly beneficial, because clustering selects for cooperation but decreases population size. Individual-based simulations with variable individual movement rates produced variation in spatial clustering and the hypothesized negative cooperation-population relationships. These results suggest that variation in spatial clustering can limit the size of evolutionarily stable cooperating populations - an ecological dilemma of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Chemicals are involved in mediating a diverse array of inter- and intraspecific interactions including predation, competition, mutualism, and reproductive processes, as well as interactions between organisms and their physical environment. This diversity is best exemplified in the mobile invertebrates. Mobile invertebrates are the dominant predators and herbivores in many marine systems and serve as keystone species in several of these systems. Thus, factors (including chemistry) that determine their distribution, abundance, and impact on communities and ecosystems should be of broad interest to marine biologists and ecologists. Straightforward production of predator-deterrent chemicals is rare in this group as compared to sessile invertebrates and seaweeds, and this has led the ecologists and chemists studying these organisms to diversify in terms of the types of interactions they study. Waterborne chemicals help mobile invertebrates locate food, mates, and appropriate habitats or symbiotic partners; they also help regulate and synchronize reproductive cycles and alert organisms to the danger of nearby predators. Nevertheless, the bulk of research on chemically mediated interactions has focused on predator-prey interactions, so much of the chapter is necessarily devoted to these interactions. In areas where rigorous studies involving mobile benthic invertebrates are rare (e.g., antifouling and allelopathy), examples from other groups (plants, sessile invertebrates, or vertebrates) or habitats (open water marine, freshwater, or terrestrial) are provided to identify areas deserving increased attention. More detailed treatments of particular types of interactions or habitats can be found in the other chapters of this volume.  2001 by CRC Press LLC.",1,"MA44","","","",""

We examined 325 specimens and identified four species: T. bidentata (72.9% of total abundance), T. digitalis (23.1%), T. formosa Smith, 1869 (3.4%), and T. corallina Gerstaecker, 1857 (0.6%). Three carapace measurements were taken for each specimen: carapace width (CW), carapace length (CL), and interocular distance (ID). The variables CL and ID were fit to a power equation taking CW as the reference dimension. As in other brachyurans, growth pattern analyses indicated an isometric type in all CW vs CL and CW vs ID relationships examined. Interspecific differences included a larger body size for T. bidentata and larger ID/CW for T. digitalis. Significant intraspecific differences in the two insular populations of T. digitalis were evidenced in the ID/CW ratio. In contrast, populations of T. bidentata were morphometrically closer. These results indicate a higher degree of connectedness of the parts of the T. bidentata metapopulation than of that of T. digitalis, probably due to differences in the duration of their larval stages. We think that the larger body size in T. bidentata might account for competitive advantages in food gathering and habitat selection over the remaining species. In turn, as a counteracting trait for its smaller size, the larger ID might allow T. digitalis a better ability to perceive 3D and to judge relative distances between objects, thus avoiding competitive combats and improving antipredatory or escape responses.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",1,"MA40","","","",""

Such encounters typically lead to a natural histocompatibility response in which colonies either fuse to become a single, chimeric colony or reject and aggressively compete for space. These allorecognition phenomena mediate intraspecific competition [1-3], support allotypic diversity [4], control the level atwhich selection acts [5-8], and resemble allogeneic interactions in pregnancy and transplantation [9-12]. Despite the ubiquity of allorecognition in colonial phyla, however, its molecular basis has not been identified beyond what is currently known about histocompatibility in vertebrates and protochordates. We positionally cloned an allorecognition gene by using inbred strains of the cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which is a model system for the study of invertebrate allorecognition. The gene identified encodes a putative transmembrane receptor expressed in all tissues capable of allorecognition that is highly polymorphic and predicts allorecognition responses in laboratory and field-derived strains.

In the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata, the number of sperm transferred during copulation depended on copulation duration and males in good condition (residual weight) copulated longer and also transferred more sperm. Moreover, sperm transferred and stored per unit time was higher in copulations with females in good condition than in copulations with females in poor condition.

To better understand the multipartite context of the fig-fig wasp association, we used a culture-free approach to examine fungal communities associated with syconia of six species of Ficus and their pollinating wasps in lowland Panama. Diverse fungi were recovered from surface-sterilized flowers of all Ficus species, including gall- and seed flowers at four developmental stages. Fungal communities in syconia and on pollinating wasps were similar, dominated by diverse and previously unknown Saccharomycotina, and distinct from leaf- and stem endophyte communities in the same region. Before pollination, fungal communities were similar between gall- and seed flowers and among Ficus species. However, fungal communities differed significantly in flowers after pollination vs. before pollination, and between anciently diverged lineages of Ficus with active vs. passive pollination syndromes. Within groups of relatively closely related figs, there was little evidence for strict-sense host specificity between figs and particular fungal species. Instead, mixing of fungal communities among related figs, coupled with evidence for possible transfer by pollinating wasps, is consistent with recent suggestions of pollinator mixing within syconia.

Resource mutualism theory provides predictions based on variation in abiotic and biotic factors. First, there is substantial intraspecific genetic variation in how legumes interact with rhizobia, including variation in legume growth response to rhizobia, number of rhizobia-housing nodules and nitrogen fixation. Rhizobia likely have greater community impacts when associating with hosts that benefit greatly from rhizobia, produce many nodules and fix a lot of nitrogen. Second, increased soil nutrient availability typically reduces the partner benefits of legume-rhizobium interactions. As a result, the legume-rhizobium resource mutualism may have greater effects on communities in low-nitrogen environments. We first conducted a common garden study of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata to explore intraspecific variation in focal traits related to competition and mutualistic interactions with rhizobia. Then, we manipulated the presence of rhizobia, nitrogen fertilization and population identity of C.fasciculata in mesocosms simulating native plant communities. We measured plant diversity, assessed changes in community composition and measured soil nutrient availability. We detected significant genetically based intraspecific variation in growth and mutualism-related traits across C.fasciculata populations. From the experimental mesocosms, we found that although rhizobia consistently reduced diversity, rhizobia most strongly reduced diversity when associating with C.fasciculata populations that were highly dependent on rhizobia and when nitrogen was most limiting. We also detected greater variation among populations in their effects on communities in the absence of rhizobia; the presence of rhizobia dramatically minimized effects of population identity on the surrounding community.Synthesis. These findings show that abiotic environmental factors and intraspecific variation in a dominant host plant can influence the magnitude of mutualism effects on communities and, reciprocally, how the presence of key mutualists can influence the importance of genetically based variation among populations to community outcomes. While prior studies have detected both strong and weak effects of mutualism on plant communities, our study illustrates that mutualism theory may predict when strong mutualism effects are most likely to occur and also shows how theories developed for particular species interactions may make studies investigating the ecological impacts of genetic variation a more predictive science.",1,"MA409","","","",""

Results from the first two games largely replicated our previous findings. Responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma were more varied than was seen in previous games, with pairs respectively cooperating, defecting, and failing to establish stable strategies.

The maintenance of stable multipartite symbioses with seemingly less competitive symbionts in similar habitats is of fundamental interest to ecology and evolution. We tested the hypothesis that the coexistence of three fungal species associated with the mountain pine beetle is the result of niche partitioning and adaptive radiation using SNP genotyping coupled with genotype-environment association analysis and phenotypic characterization of growth rate under different temperatures. We found that genetic variation and population structure within each species is best explained by distinct spatial and environmental variables. We observed both common (temperature seasonality and the host species) and distinct (drought, cold stress, precipitation) environmental and spatial factors that shaped the genomes of these fungi resulting in contrasting outcomes. Phenotypic intraspecific variations in Grosmannia clavigera and Leptographium longiclavatum, together with high heritability, suggest potential for adaptive selection in these species. By contrast, Ophiostoma montium displayed narrower intraspecific variation but greater tolerance to extreme high temperatures. Our study highlights unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in these symbionts that are consistent with our hypothesis. By maintaining this multipartite relationship, the bark beetles have a greater likelihood of obtaining the benefits afforded by the fungi and reduce the risk of being left aposymbiotic.

Within chemoautotrophic associations, as described in several studies, the use of other genetic markers may reveal previously unobserved strain diversity among gill endosymbionts. Herein, we conducted a survey of symbionts harbored by six species within the Lucinidae family using five genetic markers (dnaE, gyrB, aprA, cbbL genes and the 16S23S internal transcribed spacer).

This diversity is structured in function of the geographic location of the hosts and not in function of ecological parameters or host phylogeny. Interestingly at the local level (same seagrass bed environment), we observed an unexpected specificity in host species/bacterial strain association (i.e., all individuals of the same host species harbor the same symbiotic sequence type). This specificity of association implied that there was a control of symbiont strain acquisition by the host, which was confirmed by a cross-infection experiment of starved adults performed in our study.

Aphids are among the most detrimental agricultural pests worldwide, and parasitoid wasps are frequently employed for their control. The use of asexual parasitoids may improve the effectiveness of biological control because only females kill hosts and because asexual populations have a higher growth rate than sexuals. However, asexuals may have a reduced capacity to track evolutionary change in their host populations. We used a factorial experiment to compare the ability of sexual and asexual populations of the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum to control caged populations of black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) of high and low clonal diversity. The aphids came from a natural population, and one-third of the aphid clones harbored Hamiltonella defensa, a heritable bacterial endosymbiont that increases resistance to parasitoids. We followed aphid and parasitoid population dynamics for 3months but found no evidence that the reproductive mode of parasitoids affected their effectiveness as biocontrol agents, independent of host clonal diversity. Parasitoids failed to control aphids in most cases, because their introduction resulted in strong selection for clones protected by H.defensa. The increasingly resistant aphid populations escaped control by parasitoids, and we even observed parasitoid extinctions in many cages. The rapid evolution of symbiont-conferred resistance in turn imposed selection on parasitoids. In cages where asexual parasitoids persisted until the end of the experiment, they became dominated by a single genotype able to overcome the protection provided by H.defensa. Thus, there was evidence for parasitoid counteradaptation, but it was generally too slow for parasitoids to regain control over aphid populations. It appears that when pest aphids possess defensive symbionts, the presence of parasitoid genotypes able to overcome symbiont-conferred resistance is more important for biocontrol success than their reproductive mode.  2017 The Authors.

"Franz2011","The evolution of cooperative turn-taking in animal conflict","Franz, M. and Van Der Post, D. and Schlke, O. and Ostner, J.","BMC Evolutionary Biology",11,"1",NA,2011,"10.1186/1471-2148-11-323","Background: A fundamental assumption in animal socio-ecology is that animals compete over limited resources. This view has been challenged by the finding that individuals might cooperatively partition resources by ""taking turns"". Turn-taking occurs when two individuals coordinate their agonistic behaviour in a way that leads to an alternating pattern in who obtains a resource without engaging in costly fights. Cooperative turn-taking has been largely ignored in models of animal conflict and socio-ecological models that explain the evolution of social behaviours based only on contest and scramble competition. Currently it is unclear whether turn-taking should be included in socio-ecological models because the evolution of turn-taking is not well understood. In particular, it is unknown whether turn-taking can evolve when fighting costs and assessment of fighting abilities are not fixed but emerge from evolved within-fight behaviour. We address this problem with an evolutionary agent-based model. Results: We found that turn-taking evolves for small resource values, alongside a contest strategy that leads to stable dominance relationships. Turn-taking leads to egalitarian societies with unclear dominance relationships and non-linear dominance hierarchies. Evolutionary stability of turn-taking emerged despite strength differences among individuals and the possibility to evolve within-fight behaviour that allows good assessment of fighting abilities. Evolutionary stability emerged from frequency-dependent effects on fitness, which are modulated by feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies. Conclusions: Our results reveal the impact of feedbacks between the evolution of within-fight behaviour and the evolution of higher-level conflict strategies, such as turn-taking. Similar feedbacks might be important for the evolution of other conflict strategies such as winner-loser effects or coalitions. However, we are not aware of any study that investigated such feedbacks. Furthermore, our model suggests that turn-taking could be used by animals to partition low value resources, but to our knowledge this has never been tested. The existence of turn-taking might have been overlooked because it leads to societies with similar characteristics that have been expected to emerge from scramble competition. Analyses of temporal interaction patterns could be used to test whether turn-taking occurs in animals.  2011Franz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2,"MA373","","","",""

Recently, two major themes of research have developed. First, there has been a growing interest in the proximate, mechanistic processes underpinning parasite-associated behaviour change, and the interactive roles of the neuro-, immune, and other physiological systems in determining relationships between behaviour and infection susceptibility. Secondly, as the study of behaviour has shifted away from one-off measurements of single behaviours and towards a behavioural syndromes/personality framework, research is starting to focus on the consequences of parasite infection for temporal and contextual consistency of behaviour, and on the implications of different personality types for infection susceptibility. In addition, there is increasing interest in the potential for relationships between cognition and personality to also have implications for host-parasite interactions. As models well-suited to both the laboratory study of behaviour and experimental parasitology, teleost fish have been used as hosts in many of these studies. In this review we provide a broad overview of the range of mechanisms that potentially generate links between fish behaviour, personality, and parasitism, and illustrate these using examples drawn from the recent literature. In addition, we examine the potential interactions between cognition, personality and parasitism, and identify questions that may be usefully investigated with fish models.  2016 Elsevier B.V.",1,"MA270","","","",""

Microbiota might play a role in social systems as well, because microbes are transmitted during social contact and can affect host behaviour. Combining methods from behavioural and molecular research, we describe the relationship between social dynamics and gut microbiota of a group-living cooperative species of primate, the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Specifically, we ask whether patterns of social contact (group membership, group size, position in social network, individual sociality) are associated with patterns of gut microbial composition (diversity and similarity) between individuals and across time. Red-bellied lemurs were found to have gut microbiota with slight temporal fluctuations and strong social group-specific composition. Contrary to expectations, individual sociality was negatively associated with gut microbial diversity. However, position within the social network predicted gut microbial composition. These results emphasize the role of the social environment in determining the microbiota of adult animals. Since social transmission of gut microbiota has the potential to enhance immunity, microbiota might have played an escalating role in the evolution of sociality.  2017 The Authors.

Here we investigate the factors that influence individual contributions to group-level benefits by studying individual participation in territorial defense among female ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta). To control for potentially confounding factors, particularly group size, we studied two semi-free-ranging groups at the Duke University Primate Center. First, we used a combination of experimental and observational methods to investigate the costs and benefits of territorial defense for individual lemurs. We found three indications of costs: physical contact occurred during inter-group encounters, participation in territorial defense was negatively correlated with ambient temperature, and rates of self-directed behaviors increased during encounters. Benefits were more difficult to quantify, but observational and experimental tests suggested that individuals shared the gains of territorial defense by foraging in defended territories. Thus, during experiments in which one of the groups was prevented from defending its territory, the free-ranging group made more frequent incursions into the other group's territory. Second, we examined variation in participation in territorial defense. Individuals varied significantly in their rates of aggression and genital marking during inter-group encounters. The extensive variation documented among individuals was partially accounted for by dominance rank, kinship and patterns of parental care. However, we found no evidence to suggest that participation was enforced through punishment (policing) or exchange of benefits involving grooming. In conclusion, this study provides further insights into cooperative behavior in mammalian social groups by revealing how the costs and benefits of territoriality influence patterns of individual participation in the context of shared (collective) goods.

Many hypothesized roles are related to modifying bioluminescence spectra or modulating the light regime for algal symbionts, but these do not explain the presence of GFPs in animals that are non-luminous and non-symbiotic. Other hypothesized functions are unrelated to the visual signals themselves, including stress responses and antioxidant roles, but these cannot explain the localization of fluorescence in particular structures on the animals. Here we tested the hypothesis that fluorescence might serve to attract prey. In laboratory experiments, the predator was the hydromedusa Olindias formosus ( previously known as O. formosa), which has fluorescent and pigmented patches on the tips of its tentacles. The prey, juvenile rockfishes in the genus Sebastes, were significantly more attracted (P<1?10-5 ) to the medusa's tentacles under lighting conditions where fluorescence was excited and tentacle tips were visible above the background. The fish did not respond significantly when treatments did not include fluorescent structures or took place under yellow or white lights, which did not generate fluorescence visible above the ambient light. Furthermore, underwater observations of the behavior of fishes when presented with a brightly illuminated point showed a strong attraction to this visual stimulus. In situ observations also provided evidence for fluorescent lures as supernormal stimuli in several other marine animals, including the siphonophore Rhizophysa eysenhardti. Our results support the idea that fluorescent structures can serve as prey attractants, thus providing a potential function for GFPs and other fluorescent proteins in a diverse range of organisms.  2015.

The objective of this study was to determine how interspecific competition, mycorrhizal symbiosis, and their interactions influence plant community structure. We conducted a factorial experiment, which incorporated manipulations of abundance of dominant competitors, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, and suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis using the fungicide benomyl under two fire regimes (annual and 4-year burn intervals). Removal of the two dominant C-4 grass species altered the community structure, increased plant species richness, diversity, and evenness, and increased abundance of subdominant graminoid and forb species. Suppression of mycorrhizal fungi resulted in smaller shifts in community structure, although plant species richness and diversity increased. Responses of individual plant species were associated with their degree of mycorrhizal responsiveness: highly mycorrhizal responsive species decreased in abundance and less mycorrhizal responsive species increased in abundance. The combination of dominant-grass removal and mycorrhizal suppression treatments interacted to increase synergistically the abundance of several species, indicating that both processes influence species interactions and community organization in tallgrass prairie. These results provide evidence that mycorrhizal fungi affect plant communities indirectly by influencing the pattern and strength of plant competitive interactions. Burning strongly influenced the outcome of these interactions, which suggests that plant species diversity in tallgrass prairie is influenced by a complex array of interacting processes, including both competition and mycorrhizal symbiosis.",2,"MA210","","","",""

Models based on optimum diet theory (ODT) can be used to predict different patterns of variation in resource use among individuals. In this work, we investigated the diet and measured the degree of individual specialization of three anuran species, Hypsiboas leptolineatus, Pseudis cardosoi and Scinax granulatus, from the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. The study is based on gut content obtained using a stomach-flushing technique. Additionally, we tested for a correlation between the individuals' diet and morphological variation. Furthermore, we applied methods based on network theory to investigate patterns of resource use among individuals of each species. All three study species showed generalized diets and significant values of individual specialization. However, we did not find any correlation between diet and morphology, indicating that diet variation is not a consequence of morphological trade-offs. The individual-resource networks of H.leptolineatus and S.granulatus showed a nested pattern. This result indicates the presence of individuals with more diverse diets than others, and the diets of the more specialist individuals are a predictable subset of the diets of the more generalist ones. The individual-resource network of P.cardosoi did not show a distinct pattern, diverging from what was predicted by optimal diet theory-based models. Although nested or modular patterns are commonly found in individual-resource networks, our results indicate that they are not ubiquitous and that random patterns can also be found.",1,"MA213","","","",""
