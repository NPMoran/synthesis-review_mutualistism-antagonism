"Plant-animal mutualism in biological markets: Evolutionary and ecological dynamics driven by non-heritable phenotypic variance","Mutualism between plants and animals, such as in pollination and seed dispersal, is a fundamental mechanism facilitating the productivity and biodiversity of ecosystems, and it is often considered as an analog of a free-market economy. The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological market is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","MA284","PT","","",""
"Molecular evidence for multiple infections of a new subgroup of Wolbachia in the European raspberry beetle Byturus tomentosus","Wolbachia, a group of maternally inherited intracellular parasitic bacteria, alter host reproduction, including the induction of thelytokous parthenogenesis, feminization of genetic males, son killing and, most commonly, the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), in a diverse array of arthropods. CI can result in infertility and has attracted attention because of its potential in biological control and as an agent in speciation. Although there has been some analysis of overall infection rates in arthropods and within individual insect orders, there has been little exploration of within-species variation. In this study, primers specific for the ftsZ gene of Wolbachia were used to amplify it from different geographical samples of the European raspberry beetle (Byturus tomentosus), confirming the presence of Wolbachia. More than 99% of UK individuals were found to be infected with Wolbachia and 97% of these B. tomentosus beetles harboured multiple infections. Preliminary analysis of B. tomentosus beetles from continental European populations revealed a lower level of infection (24%) than those from the UK. Phylogenetic analysis using the ftsZ DNA sequences places Wolbachia from B. tomentosus into a new clade (Abt) within the A division, with some revisions to the existing Wolbachia phylogeny.","MA248","PT","","",""
"Eukarya associated with the stony coral Oculina patagonica from the Mediterranean Sea","Oculina patagonica is a putative alien scleractinian coral from the Southwest Atlantic that inhabits across the Mediterranean Sea. Here, we have addressed the diversity of Eukarya associated with this coral and its changes related to the environmental conditions and coral status. A total of 46 colonies of O. patagonica were taken from Alicante coast (Spain) and Pietra Ligure coast (Italy) and analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the small-subunit 18S rRNA and 16S plastid rRNA genes, internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2) analyses, and electron microscopy. Our results show that Eukarya and plastid community associated to O. patagonica change with environmental conditions and coral status. Cryptic species, which can be difficult to identify by optical methods, were distinguished by 18S rRNA gene DGGE: the barnacle Megatrema anglicum, which was detected at two locations, and two boring sponges related to Cliona sp. and Siphonodictyon coralliphagum detected in samples from Tabarca and Alicante Harbour, respectively. Eukaryotic phototrophic community from the skeletal matrix of healthy corals was dominated by Ochrosphaera sp. while bleached corals from the Harbour and Tabarca were associated to different uncultured phototrophic organism. Differences in ultrastructural morphologies of the zooxanthellae between healthy and bleached corals were observed. Nevertheless, no differences were found in Symbiodinium community among time, environments, coral status and location, showing that O. patagonica hosted only one genotype of Symbiodinium belonging to clade B2. The fact that this clade has not been previously detected in other Mediterranean corals and is more frequent in the tropical Western Atlantic, is a new evidence that O. patagonica is an alien species in the Mediterranean Sea.  2014 Elsevier B.V.","MA121","PT","","",""
"Group size effects in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs","In groups of cooperative breeders, individual fitness can increase as a direct consequence of group size, whereby the extent of these benefits is likely to depend, to a degree that is largely unknown, on the prevailing ecological conditions. We examined the effect of group size on pup production and survival across age classes in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, across 12 quasiexperimental sites in South Africa varying in ecological conditions. In this sample spanning over 43 pack-years, group size had a significantly positive effect on litter size after emergence from the den, but not on number of pups surviving to 1 year of age or survival rates for pups, yearlings and adults. Stronger relationships between these variables have been reported in other samples, so these results might be explained by low competitor density and high prey availability in our study areas. This explanation is supported by the finding that neither of these variables had any significant effect on pup production and survival across age classes in the present study. The results of our quasiexperimental study suggest that varying ecological conditions represent an important source of intraspecific variation in the impact of helpers in cooperative breeders.

"Does soil type drive social organization in southern hairy-nosed wombats?","Spatiotemporal distributions of key resources are hypothesized to underpin sociobiological patterns. Burrow availability and quality is of paramount importance to fossorial animals. The southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows in both hard and friable soils. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the harder substrate should promote closer geographical clustering of burrows than in softer soils. Clustered burrows are expected to be associated with larger group sizes. If sociality is driven by constraint rather than advantage, patterns of spatial and temporal distribution of animals within and among groups may show indications of avoidance or even antagonism, and `making the best of a bad job' via positive kin associations to offset the disadvantages of high-density living. To test these ideas, we compared warren relatedness and social structure of L. latifrons on friable soils (Nullarbor Plain) and hard calcrete (Brookfield Conservation Park, BCP). Individuals were sampled by noninvasive collection of hairs for genotyping to identify individuals and to estimate their space-use and associative behaviour with respect to relatedness. Burrows in calcrete were indeed more clumped, and warren and group size larger. Differences in spatiotemporal organization and relatedness structure between sites were in the expected direction: (i) Nullarbor males associated and shared warrens less than at BCP; and (ii) Nullarbor spatial relatedness patterning data were not consistent with proposed female breeding dispersal, in contrast to those at BCP. Under Nullarbor (low density) conditions, cooperation or tolerance between males may be less advantageous, and accessing or digging burrows should be less of a constraint for juvenile females.","MA103","PT","","",""
"Reconciling with Valuable Partners by Longtailed Macaques","In primates and other social mammals, opponents in aggressive conflicts have been reported to seek one another out after fights for various types of friendly interaction. In longtailed macaques, these friendly reunions have been shown to restore aspects of the social relationship of the opponents to their preconflict state, and they have thus been interpreted as reconciliations. Although postconflict reconciliation would seem to be adaptive to gregarious animals that establish individualized social relationships, its occurrence is variable among species, groups and dyads. Some of this variation probably reflects costs and benefits of reconciling in different situations. One factor that might influence the benefit of reconciliation and hence its occurrence is the value of the social partner as a social or ecological resource: reconciliation should occur more often after fights with valuable social partners. We conducted an experiment to test this hypothesis using pairs of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) as their own controls. First, baseline rates of reconciliation after experimenterinduced conflict were measured. Then, the value of the relationship, at least in the test context, was increased by training each pair of monkeys to perform a simple cooperative task in which each got access to food only if the partner fed nearby simultaneously. Finally, the reconciliation rate was measured again after training and compared to its baseline value. In 6 of 7 dyads, the reconciliation rate increased after training, and the median reconciliation rate after training was 3 times higher than at baseline. While the results are consistent with the value hypothesis, there are other potential explanations. Comparison of friendly behavior when there had been no prior aggression in baseline and posttraining phases, however, suggested that the increase in reconciliation rate was neither the result of a general increase in compatibility nor the result of anticipated conflict in the cofeeding context. 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","MA301","PT","","",""
"Population-specific responses to an invasive species","Predicting the impacts of non-native species remains a challenge. As populations of a species are genetically and phenotypically variable, the impact of non-native species on local taxa could crucially depend on populations-pecific traits and adaptations of both native and non-native species. Bitterling fishes are brood parasites of unionid mussels and unionid mussels produce larvae that parasitize fishes. We used common garden experiments to measure three key elements in the bitterlingmussel association among two populations of an invasive mussel (Anodonta woodiana) and four populations of European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). The impact of the invasive mussel varied between geographically distinct R. amarus lineages and between local populations within lineages. The capacity of parasitic larvae of the invasive mussel to exploit R. amarus was higher in a Danubian than in a Baltic R. amarus lineage and in allopatric than in sympatric R. amarus populations. Maladaptive oviposition by R. amarus into A. woodiana varied among populations, with significant population-specific consequences for R. amarus recruitment. We suggest that variation in coevolutionary states may predispose different populations to divergent responses. Given that coevolutionary relationships are ubiquitous, population-specific attributes of invasive and native populations may play a critical role in the outcome of invasion. We argue for a shift from a species-centred to population-centred perspective of the impacts of invasions.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Variable ecological conditions promote male helping by changing banded mongoose group composition","Ecological conditions are expected to have an important influence on individuals' investment in cooperative care. However, the nature of their effects is unclear: both favorable and unfavorable conditions have been found to promote helping behavior. Recent studies provide a possible explanation for these conflicting results by suggesting that increased ecological variability, rather than changes in mean conditions, promote cooperative care. However, no study has tested whether increased ecological variability promotes individual-level helping behavior or the mechanisms involved. We test this hypothesis in a long-term study population of the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, using 14 years of behavioral and meteorological data to explore how the mean and variability of ecological conditions influence individual behavior, body condition, and survival. Female body condition was more sensitive to changes in rainfall leading to poorer female survival and pronounced male-biased group compositions after periods of high rainfall variability. After such periods, older males invested more in helping behavior, potentially because they had fewer mating opportunities. These results provide the first empirical evidence for increased individual helping effort in more variable ecological conditions and suggest this arises because of individual differences in the effect of ecological conditions on body condition and survival, and the knock-on effect on social group composition. Individual differences in sensitivity to environmental variability, and the impacts this has on the internal structure and composition of animal groups, can exert a strong influence on the evolution and maintenance of social behaviors, such as cooperative care.","MA401","PT","","",""
"Fitness costs of phoretic nematodes in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides","Nicrophorusvespilloides is a social beetle that rears its offspring on decomposing carrion. Wild beetles are frequently associated with two types of macrobial symbionts, mites, and nematodes. Although these organisms are believed to be phoretic commensals that harmlessly use beetles as a means of transfer between carcasses, the role of these symbionts on N.vespilloides fitness is poorly understood. Here, we show that nematodes have significant negative effects on beetle fitness across a range of worm densities and also quantify the density-dependent transmission of worms between mating individuals and from parents to offspring. Using field-caught beetles, we provide the first report of a new nematode symbiont in N.vespilloides, most closely related to Rhabditoides regina, and show that worm densities are highly variable across individuals isolated from nature but do not differ between males and females. Next, by inoculating mating females with increasing densities of nematodes, we show that worm infections significantly reduce brood size, larval survival, and larval mass, and also eliminate the trade-off between brood size and larval mass. Finally, we show that nematodes are efficiently transmitted between mating individuals and from mothers to larvae, directly and indirectly via the carcass, and that worms persist through pupation. These results show that the phoretic nematode R.regina can be highly parasitic to burying beetles but can nevertheless persist because of efficient mechanisms of intersexual and intergenerational transmission. Phoretic species are exceptionally common and may cause significant harm to their hosts, even though they rely on these larger species for transmission to new resources. However, this harm may be inevitable and unavoidable if transmission of phoretic symbionts requires nematode proliferation. It will be important to determine the generality of our results for other phoretic associates of animals. It will equally be important to assess the fitness effects of phoretic species under changing resource conditions and in the field where diverse interspecific interactions may exacerbate or reduce the negative effects of phoresy.  2018 The Authors.

"Feeding repellence in Antarctic bryozoans","The Antarctic sea star Odontaster validus and the amphipod Cheirimedon femoratus are important predators in benthic communities. Some bryozoans are part of the diet of the asteroid and represent both potential host biosubstrata and prey for this omnivorous lysianassid amphipod. In response to such ecological pressure, bryozoans are expected to develop strategies to deter potential predators, ranging from physical to chemical mechanisms. However, the chemical ecology of Antarctic bryozoans has been scarcely studied. In this study we evaluated the presence of defenses against predation in selected species of Antarctic bryozoans. The sympatric omnivorous consumers O. validus and C. femoratus were selected to perform feeding assays with 16 ether extracts (EE) and 16 butanol extracts (BE) obtained from 16 samples that belonged to 13 different bryozoan species. Most species (9) were active (12 EE and 1 BE) in sea star bioassays. Only 1 BE displayed repellence, indicating that repellents against the sea star are mainly lipophilic. Repellence toward C. femoratus was found in all species in different extracts (10 EE and 12 BE), suggesting that defenses against the amphipod might be both lipophilic and hydrophilic. Interspecific and intraspecific variability of bioactivity was occasionally detected, suggesting possible environmental inductive responses, symbiotic associations, and/or genetic variability. Multivariate analysis revealed similarities among species in relation to bioactivities of EE and/or BE. These findings support the hypothesis that, while in some cases alternative chemical or physical mechanisms may also provide protection, repellent compounds play an important role in Antarctic bryozoans as defenses against predators.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","MA145","PT","","",""
"Genetic clusters and sex-biased gene flow in a unicolonial Formica ant","Background: Animal societies are diverse, ranging from small family-based groups to extraordinarily large social networks in which many unrelated individuals interact. At the extreme of this continuum, some ant species form unicolonial populations in which workers and queens can move among multiple interconnected nests without eliciting aggression. Although unicoloniality has been mostly studied in invasive ants, it also occurs in some native non-invasive species. Unicoloniality is commonly associated with very high queen number, which may result in levels of relatedness among nestmates being so low as to raise the question of the maintenance of altruism by kin selection in such systems. However, the actual relatedness among cooperating individuals critically depends on effective dispersal and the ensuing pattern of genetic structuring. In order to better understand the evolution of unicoloniality in native non-invasive ants, we investigated the fine-scale population genetic structure and gene flow in three unicolonial populations of the wood ant F. paralugubris. Results: The analysis of geo-referenced microsatellite genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes revealed the presence of cryptic clusters of genetically-differentiated nests in the three populations of F. paralugubris. Because of this spatial genetic heterogeneity, members of the same clusters were moderately but significantly related. The comparison of nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial differentiation indicated that effective gene flow was male-biased in all populations. Conclusion: The three unicolonial populations exhibited male-biased and mostly local gene flow. The high number of queens per nest, exchanges among neighbouring nests and restricted long-distance gene flow resulted in large clusters of genetically similar nests. The positive relatedness among clustermates suggests that kin selection may still contribute to the maintenance of altruism in unicolonial populations if competition occurs among clusters.","MA164","PT","","",""
"Small-scale spatial heterogeneity in infection levels by symbionts of the amphipod Talorchestia quoyana (Talitridae)","The beach hopper amphipod Talorchestia quoyana is not distributed homogeneously in its sandy beach habitat, but instead occurs in dense patches under large pieces of tidal debris. This marked patchiness on a scale of just a few metres may create a higher level of aggregation among hosts for the symbionts and parasites of beach hoppers. Prevalence of infection by a mermithid nematode parasite varied significantly among 5 beach hopper patches, located within a few hundred metres of one another, on a New Zealand sandy beach. Similarly, the prevalence and mean intensity of infection by rhabditid nematodes and mites also varied significantly among beach hopper patches. This variation is not due to differences in amphipod sizes among patches, as the effect of size was controlled in the analysis. The symbionts and parasites were aggregated among individual amphipods within patches, with rhabditid nematodes also aggregated among patches, reflecting a higher, independent scale of aggregation. There were also positive associations between rhabditid nematodes and both mermithid nematodes and mites across host individuals, suggesting that individual variation among amphipods in susceptibility to symbionts may account for their aggregation within patches. These results indicate that the loosely fragmented distribution of beach hoppers is linked to a higher scale aggregation of their parasites and symbionts, a phenomenon that may impact on their population biology and that of the host.","MA326","PT","","",""
"Individual contributions to territory defence in a cooperative breeder: weighing up the benefits and costs","While investment in territory defence is expected to be influenced by its benefits, the additional role that costs may play is rarely considered. Here, we quantify both benefits and costs of repelling prospecting males in cooperative meerkats, and demonstrate that both are required to explain the substantial variation in individual contributions to the defence observed. Males benefit more from repelling prospectors than females, as males may lose dominance and be expelled during intrusions. Accordingly, males invest the most in repelling prospectors. We also show that males experience an associated cost in the form of reduced weight gain and, as such, heavier males contribute more to chasing prospectors. Finally, we show evidence of a cost not restricted to individuals engaged in chasing: both males and females reduce their contributions to feeding dependent pups when prospectors are present, resulting in a reduction in pup weight gain in this context. Males appear to adjust their contributions to chasing in light of this cost, chasing at lower rates when their group contains dependent young. Our findings support the view that investment in cooperative behaviours can be attributed to benefits and costs, and highlight the additional importance of considering trade-offs in investment between cooperative behaviours.","MA198","PT","","",""
"Behavioural and Hormonal Stress Responses to Social Separation in Ravens, Corvus corax","Social life is profitable, but it facilitates conflicts over resources and creates interdependence between individuals. Separating highly social animals triggers intense reactions aimed at re-establishing lost connections. Less is known, however, about behavioural and physiological responses to separation in socially facultative species, where individuals temporarily form groups and may subsequently leave them. Non-breeding common ravens (Corvus corax) gather in large numbers at feeding and roosting sites, but otherwise spend time seemingly solitary or in small subgroups. We here studied how ravens cope with being socially isolated, and investigated the life characteristics that might explain potential individual differences. For this, we individually separated captive subadult ravens (n=25) and housed them in physical and visual isolation from their group members across 4d. During the separation period, we collected behavioural data and measured the amount of immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites from bird droppings to assess the ravens physiological stress response. We found behavioural indicators of stress at the start of the separation, when ravens showed higher levels of tension than of comfort  a pattern that reversed at the end of the separation. Furthermore, we found that the upbringing of ravens affected their behaviour during separation. Hand-raised birds produced more vocalisations in the beginning of the separation, and were less active at the end, while the reverse pattern occurred with parent-raised ravens. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find differences in hormonal responses between the beginning and end of the separation period or any link between hormonal responses and behaviours. Ravens behavioural responses to social separation stress seem to be dependent on their arousal states, although possible links with hormonal reactions remain unclear. Our results show that behavioural reactions are not always linked with hormonal responses to stress, and further emphasise the importance of investigating effects of early-life experiences.  2016 The Authors.

"Deciphering the Interdependence between Ecological and Evolutionary Networks","Biological systems consist of elements that interact within and across hierarchical levels. For example, interactions among genes determine traits of individuals, competitive and cooperative interactions among individuals influence population dynamics, and interactions among species affect the dynamics of communities and ecosystem processes. Such systems can be represented as hierarchical networks, but can have complex dynamics when interdependencies among levels of the hierarchy occur. We propose integrating ecological and evolutionary processes in hierarchical networks to explore interdependencies in biological systems. We connect gene networks underlying predator-prey trait distributions to food webs. Our approach addresses longstanding questions about how complex traits and intraspecific trait variation affect the interdependencies among biological levels and the stability of meta-ecosystems.","MA86","PT","","",""
"Rapid viral symbiogenesis via changes in parasitoid wasp genome architecture","Viral genome integration provides a complex route to biological innovation that has rarely but repeatedly occurred in one of the most diverse lineages of organisms on the planet, parasitoid wasps. We describe a novel endogenous virus in braconid wasps derived from pathogenic alphanudiviruses. Limited to a subset of the genus Fopius, this recent acquisition allows an unprecedented opportunity to examine early endogenization events. Massive amounts of virus-like particles (VLPs) are produced in wasp ovaries. Unlike most endogenous viruses of parasitoid wasps, the VLPs do not contain DNA, translating to major differences in parasitism-promoting strategies. Rapid changes include genomic rearrangement, loss of DNA processing proteins, and wasp control of viral gene expression. These events precede the full development of tissue-specific viral gene expression observed in older associations. These data indicate that viral endogenization can rapidly result in functional and evolutionary changes associated with genomic novelty and adaptation in parasitoids.  The Author(s) 2018.

"Male reproductive skew is higher in bonobos than chimpanzees","The two closest living relatives of humans, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), share many traits that are common in humans but rare in other mammals, including societies with high fissionfusion dynamics, male philopatry, female dispersal and extensive social bonding among unrelated individuals [1]. The major difference between these two species is that male aggression is more frequent and intense in male-dominated chimpanzees than in bonobos, where the highest-ranking individuals are female [1]. One potential explanation is that because periods of female sexual receptivity and attractiveness are more extended in bonobos [2], males compete less intensely for each mating opportunity. This would reduce the strength of selection for traits that lead to success in direct contest competition between males and in sexual coercion of females, thus increasing the potential for female choice [3]. Accordingly, it has been predicted that the influence of male dominance rank on reproductive success and the extent of male reproductive skew should be lower in bonobos than in chimpanzees [1]. Although relevant for understanding the evolution of the unusual levels of egalitarianism and cooperation found in human hunter-gatherers [4], comparative analyses in the genus Pan have been limited by the scanty paternity data available for wild bonobos [5]. Here, we show using the largest sample of paternity data available that, contrary to expectation, male bonobos have a higher reproductive skew and a stronger relationship between dominance rank and reproductive success than chimpanzees.  2017 Elsevier Ltd","MA236","PT","","",""
"Adaptive divergence in a defense symbiosis driven from the top down","Most studies of adaptive radiation in animals focus on resource competition as the primary driver of trait divergence. The roles of other ecological interactions in shaping divergent phenotypes during such radiations have received less attention. We evaluate natural enemies as primary agents of diversifying selection on the phenotypes of an actively diverging lineage of gall midges on tall goldenrod. In this system, the gall of the midge consists of a biotrophic fungal symbiont that develops on host-plant leaves and forms distinctly variable protective carapaces over midge larvae. Through field studies, we show that fungal gall morphology, which is induced by midges (i.e., it is an extended phenotype), is under directional and diversifying selection by parasitoid enemies. Overall, natural enemies disruptively select for either small or large galls, mainly along the axis of gall thickness. These results imply that predators are driving the evolution of phenotypic diversity in symbiotic defense traits in this system and that divergence in defensive morphology may provide ecological opportunities that help to fuel the adaptive radiation of this genus of midges on goldenrods. This enemy-driven phenotypic divergence in a diversifying lineage illustrates the potential importance of consumerresource and symbiotic species interactions in adaptive radiation.  2018 by The University of Chicago.

"Spatial evolutionary dynamics produce a negative cooperation-population size relationship","Natural selection can favour cooperation, but it is unclear when cooperative populations should be larger than less cooperative ones. While experiments have shown that cooperation can increase population size, cooperation and population size can become negatively correlated if spatial processes affect both variables in opposite directions. We use a simple mathematical model of spatial common-pool resource production to investigate how space affects the cooperation-population size relationship. We find that only cooperation that is sufficiently beneficial to neighbours increases population size. However, spatial clustering variations can create a negative cooperation-population relationship between populations even when cooperation is highly beneficial, because clustering selects for cooperation but decreases population size. Individual-based simulations with variable individual movement rates produced variation in spatial clustering and the hypothesized negative cooperation-population relationships. These results suggest that variation in spatial clustering can limit the size of evolutionarily stable cooperating populations - an ecological dilemma of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"Can cleanerfish overcome temptation? A selective role for dopamine influence on cooperative-based decision making","Evidence suggests that animals are selected to make accurate choices and prioritize goals within the constraints of a given social environment to maximize fitness. These decisions are mostly based on complex processes in which value is linked to reward and cues may carry variable incentive salience. However, the level in which the incentive elicited by a cue is able to shift individual choices should differ between individuals and neurophysiological states. Here we used a notorious cooperative cleanerfish species Labroides dimidiatus to probe for differences in the incentive motivational valences given to food cues and then tested for the role of the dopaminergic system in the appraisal of such cues. We found that cleaners differed in Pavlovian conditioned approach behavioural responses to reward-associated stimuli: while the majority were fast to engage physically with the cue plate that indicated future reward delivery (sign trackers), only a few took significantly more time to respond (goal trackers). But amongst those that were considering the sole cue attractive, we discovered that the dopaminergic blockage decreased their initial propensity to approach and touch the cue plate. Our results show that dopamine disruption contributes to shifting the attribution of motivational incentive from the predictive cue towards the actual reward and provides key insight into the physiological framework of cooperative-based decision making.

"Geography has a greater effect than Wolbachia infection on population genetic structure in the spider mite, Tetranychus pueraricola","Wolbachia is an intracellular symbiotic bacterium that infects various spider mite species and is associated with alterations in host reproduction, which indicates the potential role in mite evolution. However, studies of Wolbachia infections in the spider mite Tetranychus pueraricola, a major agricultural pest, are limited. Here, we used multilocus sequence typing to determine Wolbachia infection status and examined the relationship between Wolbachia infection status and mitochondrial diversity in T. pueraricola from 12 populations in China. The prevalence of Wolbachia ranged from 2.8 to 50%, and three strains (wTpue1, wTpue2, and wTpue3) were identified. We also found double infections (wTpue1 + wTpue3) within the same individuals. Furthermore, the wTpue1 strain caused weak cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) (egg hatchability ~55%), whereas another widespread strain, wTpue3, did not induce CI. There was no reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA diversity among infected individuals, and mtDNA haplotypes did not correspond to specific Wolbachia strains. Phylogenetic analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed that the distribution of mtDNA and nuclear DNA haplotypes were significantly associated with geography. These findings indicate that Wolbachia infection in T. pueraricola is complex, but T. pueraricola genetic differentiation likely resulted from substantial geographic isolation.

"Strategic adjustment of begging effort by banded mongoose pups","Variation in the intensity of conspicuous displays raises three basic questions: (i) the relationship between internal state and display intensity, (ii) the relationship between display intensity and receiver response, and (iii) the effect of variation in receiver responsiveness on signaller behaviour. Here, I investigate the interaction between pups and helpers in the communally breeding banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), where each pup forms an exclusive relationship with a single adult helper (termed its 'escort'). By experimentally manipulating pup need, I demonstrate that changes in begging rate correspond to changes in short-term need. The data then suggest that escorts in good condition may be more responsive to increased begging and that pups associating with them increase their begging more than do pups paired with escorts in poor condition. Escorts also appear more responsive to increased begging by female pups, and female pups increase their begging more than do male pups. These results suggest that banded mongoose pups may strategically adjust their investment in begging in relation to variation in the expected pay-off. I argue that such adjustment is likely to be a general phenomenon: wherever there is variation in responsiveness to signals, signallers will be selected to identify different categories of receiver and adjust their signals in order to maximize the pay-offs. Therefore, differences in signal intensity may be as much a product of context as an indication of variation in individual phenotypic or genotypic state.  2008 The Royal Society.","MA354","PT","","",""
"Multidimensional analyses of physical performance reveal a size-dependent trade-off between suites of traits","1. Animal movement is multidimensional and complex, and to understand the motor system of wild animals in the context of their natural ecology, we must analyse how suites of performance traits both mutualistically and antagonistically affect function-a necessity highlighted by previous work on performance trade-offs. 2. Evidence from some studies of human athletes using multidimensional analyses of performance suggests that overall quality among individuals can mask functional trade-offs within them, yet no studies have tested this idea using wild animals. In this study, we investigated the possible mutualistic and antagonistic associations among eight different whole-animal performance traits in male and female northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus). 3. We detected trade-offs between pairs of performance traits when conducted on raw standardized data using both Pearson product moment correlations and partial correlation analyses. For example, grasp strength was negatively associated with beam-running speed using both analyses, suggesting that morphological designs that enhance grasp strength simultaneously compromise an animal's motor control or stability on a narrow beam. 4. In addition, we detected a trade-off between two distinct sets of performance traits; grasp strength, bite force and maximum oxygen consumption were negatively associated with jump acceleration and beam-running speed. This trade-off between sets of performance traits accounted for around one-third of the total variance in performance among individuals and was primarily driven by the effects of body size on both groups of traits. Larger body sizes improved grasp strength, bite forces and maximum oxygen consumption rates but decreased jump accelerations and beam-running speeds. 5. Because the first component of a principal component analysis based on all eight performance traits (PC(P)1) did not load in the same direction for all traits, PC(P)1 did not represent an overall metric of motor performance-which differs from previous multivariate analyses of human physical performance. Our study highlights the importance of studying suites of traits when exploring the functional phenotype of organisms rather than just one or two dimensions of performance.","MA251","PT","","",""
"Climate Change and Phenological Mismatch in Trophic Interactions Among Plants, Insects, and Vertebrates","Phenological mismatch results when interacting species change the timing of regularly repeated phases in their life cycles at different rates. We review whether this continuously ongoing phenomenon, also known as trophic asynchrony, is becoming morecommonunder ongoing rapid climate change. In antagonistic trophic interactions, any mismatch will have negative impacts for only one of the species, whereas in mutualistic interactions, both partners are expected to suffer. Trophic mismatch is therefore expected to last for evolutionarily short periods, perhaps only a few seasons, adding to the difficulty of attributing it to climate change, which requires long-term data. So far, the prediction that diverging phenologies linked to climate change will cause mismatch is most clearly met in antagonistic interactions at high latitudes in the Artic. There is limited evidence of phenological mismatch in mutualistic interactions, possibly because of strong selection on mutualists to have co-adapted phenological strategies. The study of individual plasticity, population variation, and the genetic bases for phenological strategies is in its infancy. Recent work on woody plants revealed the large imprint of historic climate change on temperature, chilling, and day-length thresholds used by different species to synchronize their phenophases, which in the Northern Hemisphere has led to biogeographic phenological regions inwhich long-lived plants have adapted to particular interannual and intermillennial amplitudes of climate change.","MA47","PT","","",""
"Regional and local patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure along an altitudinal gradient in the Hyrcanian forests of northern Iran"," Altitudinal gradients strongly affect the diversity of plants and animals, yet little is known about the altitudinal effects on the distribution of microorganisms, including ectomycorrhizal fungi.  By combining morphological and molecular identification methods, we addressed the relative effects of altitude, temperature, precipitation, host community and soil nutrient concentrations on species richness and community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi in one of the last remaining temperate old-growth forests in Eurasia.  Molecular analyses revealed 367 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi along three altitudinal transects. Species richness declined monotonically with increasing altitude. Host species and altitude were the main drivers of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community composition at both the local and regional scales. The mean annual temperature and precipitation were strongly correlated with altitude and accounted for the observed patterns of richness and community.  The decline of ectomycorrhizal fungal richness with increasing altitude is consistent with the general altitudinal richness patterns of macroorganisms. Low environmental energy reduces the competitive ability of rare species and thus has a negative effect on the richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of multicollinearity with altitude, the direct effects of climatic variables and their seasonality warrant further investigation at the regional and continental scales.  2011 The Authors.

"Species traits dictate seasonal-dependent responses of octocoralalgal symbioses to elevated temperature and ultraviolet radiation","Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can exacerbate the effects of elevated seawater temperatures concomitant with climate change. Such stressors can collapse the mutualism of scleractinian corals with their endosymbiotic unicellular algae, Symbiodinium spp. Conversely, we found that the Caribbean octocorals Pseudoplexaura crucis and Eunicea tourneforti coped with thermal and UVR stress. But, the responses differed and depended on the species biochemical properties. Furthermore, the effects of the stressors varied seasonally. For 7d, during summer and winter, we exposed the octocorals to either 3C above ambient temperature, UVR, or both. In either season, the stressors did not affect protein or carbohydrate content nor the Symbiodinium genotype. At the elevated temperature in the summer, the lipid content in P. crucis fell alongside a 35% decline in Symbiodinium. Conversely, in E. tourneforti, algal density dropped 26% with no lipid loss. In both species, the remaining Symbiodinium retained their chlorophyll and carotenoid content. In the winter, + 3C and UVR led to increased algal density, mitotic index, and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. Temperature affected more parameters than UVR, but additive, synergistic and antagonistic interactions occurred. These findings show the resilience of Caribbean gorgonian corals against stressful environmental conditions and highlight the importance of including organismal biochemical differences and seasonal responses into interpreting the effects of multiple stressors associated with global climate change.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","MA347","PT","","",""
"Complementarity in both plant and mycorrhizal fungal communities are not necessarily increased by diversity in the other","Higher species diversity can improve community performance within a species guild when different species complement each other in their use of the available niche, such as through resource partitioning. However, species in one guild of organisms may act as resources for another such that the diversity in one guild alters the realized niche for species in another. Yet, it remains largely untested as to whether diversity in one guild of organisms influences species complementarity in another. The productivity and diversity in plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities can be positively associated with each other through their typically mutualistic exchange of resources. Here, we utilized these two interacting species guilds to determine whether greater diversity in one influences species complementarity in the other. This was performed by creating monocultures and a mixture of a grass, forb and legume in a full factorial design with monocultures and a mixture of four AM fungi. The presence of AM fungi reduced differences in the performance among plant species and greater diversity of fungi generally improved plant productivity over the average of the fungal monocultures. However, plant species complementarity was not greatest with a higher diversity of fungi and was only positive with a particular fungal monoculture. AM fungal abundance was not affected by plant diversity, but was greatly reduced in the grass monoculture compared to the other plant communities. Variation in fungal complementarity among plant communities was low overall and was little influenced by plant diversity.Synthesis. Using a model plant-mycorrhizal system, our results suggest that the composition rather than the diversity of species within one guild may be more influential in determining how species function within an associated species guild. However, our model system does not represent a broad gradient of diversity in either plant or fungal communities and only assesses the initial growth phase. Nonetheless, our results highlight that changes in species compositions in one species guild can affect the functioning of species diversity in another.","MA66","PT","","",""
"Sex-dependent implications of primary productivity and conspecific density on geographical body size variation in a newt: disentangling local, large scale and genetic factors","Aim: Geographical body size variation has interested biologists since the 19th century. However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms involved, especially in amphibians. At the intraspecific level, different approximations and hypotheses have addressed this problem, but no study has integrated information at different spatio-temporal ecological and (phylo)genetic scales whilst considering differences between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms involved in geographical body size variation in the Iberian newt (Lissotriton boscai), accounting for the main hypotheses potentially explaining variation in this phenotypic trait in amphibians. Location: Iberian Peninsula. Methods: We used a novel multivariate technique (partial least squares regression) that accounts for interdependence amongst variables whilst allowing for the inclusion of multiple local and macroscale predictors. We considered intraspecific genetic differentiation including information from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in populations representative of the species distribution. We addressed causal hypotheses of heat conservation, temperature-related development, water and food availability, seasonality, competition and predation. Results: Annual primary productivity and intraspecific competition were of greatest relevance to explain body size variation in females, whilst seasonality of primary productivity was more important in males. Differences between sexes are interpreted based on previous experiments on the behavioural ecology of this species. Main conclusions: This study shows that sex-dependent implications of competition for food drive geographical body size variation in an urodele amphibian, supporting the density-resource hypothesis. Our results suggest that food availability, conspecific density and competition are important in explaining intraspecific body size variation in amphibians. This study highlights how selecting model species with an experimental background can help interpret geographical variation in phenotypic traits. We emphasize the value of simultaneously considering alternative hypotheses of phenotypic variation at different ecological and (phylo)genetic spatio-temporal scales in revealing potentially hidden relationships.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","MA316","PT","","",""
"Concordance of bacterial communities of two tick species and blood of their shared rodent host","High-throughput sequencing is revealing that most macro-organisms house diverse microbial communities. Of particular interest are disease vectors whose microbiome could potentially affect pathogen transmission and vector competence. We investigated bacterial community composition and diversity of the ticks Dermacentor variabilis (n = 68) and Ixodes scapularis (n = 15) and blood of their shared rodent host, Peromyscus leucopus (n = 45) to quantify bacterial diversity and concordance. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA from field-collected tick and rodent blood samples, and 454 pyrosequencing was used to elucidate their bacterial communities. After quality control, over 300 000 sequences were obtained and classified into 118 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity). Analysis of rarefied communities revealed that the most abundant OTUs were tick species-specific endosymbionts, Francisella and Rickettsia, and the commonly flea-associated bacterium Bartonella in rodent blood. An Arsenophonus and additional Francisella endosymbiont were also present in D. variabilis samples. Rickettsia was found in both tick species but not in rodent blood, suggesting that it is not transmitted during feeding. Bartonella was present in larvae and nymphs of both tick species, even those scored as unengorged. Relatively, few OTUs (e.g. Bartonella, Lactobacillus) were found in all sample types. Overall, bacterial communities from each sample type were significantly different and highly structured, independent of their dominant OTUs. Our results point to complex microbial assemblages inhabiting ticks and host blood including infectious agents, tick-specific endosymbionts and environmental bacteria that could potentially affect arthropod-vectored disease dynamics.  2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","MA69","PT","","",""
"Dominance hierarchies and associated signalling in a cooperative passerine","In animal societies, individuals face the dilemma of whether to cooperate or to compete over a shared resource. Two intertwined mechanisms may help to resolve this enduring evolutionary dilemma by preventing conflicts and thereby mediating the costs of living in groups: the establishment of dominance hierarchies and the use of badge-of-status for signalling dominance. We investigated these two mechanisms in the sociable weaver (Philetairus socius), a colonial and social passerine which cooperates over multiple tasks. We examined the sociable weavers dominance structure in 2years by recording 2563 agonistic interactions between 152 individuals observed at a feeder at eight colonies. We tested which individual traits, including sex, age, relatedness and two melanin-based plumage traits, predicted variation in social status. First, using social network analysis, we found that colonies were structured by strongly ordered hierarchies which were stable between years. Second, medium-ranked birds engaged more in aggressive interactions than highly ranking individuals, suggesting that competition over food is most pronounced among birds of intermediate social status. Third, we found that colony size and kinship influenced agonistic interactions, so aggression was less pronounced in smaller colonies and among relatives. Finally, within- and between-individual variation in social status and the presence of an individual at the feeder were associated with variation in bib size, as predicted by the badge-of-status hypothesis. These results suggest that dominance hierarchies and bib size mediate conflicts in sociable weaver societies.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","MA105","PT","","",""

"Dihydrofolate reductase as a therapeutic target","The folate antagonists are an important class of therapeutic compounds, as evidenced by their use as antiinfective, antineoplastic, and antiinflammatory drugs. Thus far, all of the clinically useful drugs of this class have been inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the synthesis of thymidylate, and therefore, of DNA. The basis of the antiinfective selectivity of these compounds is clear; the antifolates trimethoprim and pyrimethamine are potent inhibitors of bacterial and protozoal DHFRs, respectively, but are only weak inhibitors of mammalian DHFRs. These species-selective agents apparently exploit the differences in the active site regions of the parasite and host enzymes. Methotrexate is the DHFR inhibitor used most often in a clinical setting as an anticancer drug and as an antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agent. Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the biochemical basis for the selectivity of this drug and the biochemical mechanism (or mechanisms) responsible for the development of resistance to treatment with the drug. This understanding has led to a new generation of DHFR inhibitors that are now in clinical trials.","MA91","PT","","",""
"Resemblance within flocks and individual differences in feather mite abundance on long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus (L.)","Even though feather mites are arthropod ectosymbionts widely distributed on almost all orders of birds, the nature and functional relationship of the interaction between feather mites and birds remain unclear. In this paper, we analyzed factors determining the distribution of feather mites at the individual as well as at the flock level, searching for correlates with bird characteristics such as body size and fat accumulation during winter. Long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus (L.), live in family flocks during winter. Foraging, roosting and territory defence are done in groups. Communal roosting facilitates direct body contact among flock members, which may enhance the transmission of feather mites. Feather mites abundance was more similar within than among flocks; Within flocks, those individuals with longer wings and better body condition as determined by fat scores had larger numbers of feather mites. At the flock level, no relationship was found between mean mite intensity and any of the considered variables. We show that the distribution of feather mites among long-tailed tits is not random, but is shaped by individual features and flock ownership.","MA307","PT","","",""
"Presence of Chlamydiales DNA in ticks and fleas suggests that ticks are carriers of Chlamydiae","The Chlamydiales order includes the Chlamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Waddliaceae, Simkaniaceae, Criblamydiaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Clavichlamydiaceae, and Piscichlamydiaceae families. Members of the Chlamydiales order are obligate intracellular bacteria that replicate within eukaryotic cells of different origins including humans, animals, and amoebae. Many of these bacteria are pathogens or emerging pathogens of both humans and animals, but their true diversity is largely underestimated, and their ecology remains to be investigated. Considering their potential threat on human health, it is important to expand our knowledge on the diversity of Chlamydiae, but also to define the host range colonized by these bacteria. Thus, using a new pan-Chlamydiales PCR, we analyzed the prevalence of Chlamydiales DNA in ticks and fleas, which are important vectors of several viral and bacterial infectious diseases. To conduct this study, 1340 Ixodes ricinus ticks prepared in 192 pools were collected in Switzerland and 55 other ticks belonging to different tick species and 97 fleas belonging to different flea species were harvested in Algeria. In Switzerland, the prevalence of Chlamydiales DNA in the 192 pools was equal to 28.1% (54/192) which represents an estimated prevalence in the 1340 individual ticks of between 4.0% and 28.4%. The pan-Chlamydiales qPCR was positive for 45% (25/55) of tick samples collected in Algeria. The sequencing of the positive qPCR amplicons revealed a high diversity of Chlamydiales species. Most of them belonged to the Rhabdochlamydiaceae and Parachlamydiaceae families. Thus, ticks may carry Chlamydiales and should thus be considered as possible vectors for Chlamydiales propagation to both humans and animals.  2014 Elsevier GmbH.","MA292","PT","","",""
"Social complexity: patterns, processes, and evolution","Abstract: Animal and human societies exhibit extreme diversity in the size, composition and cohesion of their social units, in the patterning of sex-specific reproductive skew, in the nature of parental care, in the form and frequency of cooperation and in their competitive regime, creating a diversity of socially complex societies. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether social complexity is a real, emergent property of a society or whether it only provides a conceptual framework for studying the diversity and evolution of societies. In this introduction to our topical collection, we identify three areas of current research addressing relevant challenges in the study of social complexity. First, previous studies have suffered from a lack of a common conceptual framework, including shared definitions, and existing measures of social complexity do not acknowledge its multiple components and dimensions. Second, most previous studies have ignored intraspecific variation, and the proximate and ultimate determinants of variation in social complexity, as well as their interactions, remain poorly known. Third, comparative studies of social complexity offer opportunities to explore its biological causes and correlates and but it is frequently difficult to identify the causal relationships involved and the development of general insights has been hampered by conceptual and methodological difficulties. In this paper, we briefly characterize these three challenges and offer guidance to the other contributions to this topical collection on social complexity by placing their key results in the context of these three topics. Significance statement: In this paper, we address the main current challenges in the study of social complexity and combine our brief overview with a synopsis of the other contributions to this topical collection on various aspects of social complexity.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","MA333","PT","","",""
"Lethal male-male combat in the parasitoid Melittobia acasta: are size and competitive environment important?","Interactions between organisms can lie anywhere along the spectrum from fatal conflict to total cooperation. To understand this variation, knowledge of the strategies that individuals use to acquire their resources is required. We tested theoretical predictions relating to conflict behaviour in a species of parasitoid wasp, Melittobia acasta, in which males compete for mates in their closed, natal patches. They engage in lethal combat to gain access to the females developing in their host. Environmental factors and individual traits both influenced conflict behaviour and contest outcome: fighting behaviour increased with the density of competitors and larger contestants were more successful. Our results also indicate that opponent assessment did not influence conflict behaviour and contests were always resolved by fighting.

"Insect seed predators and environmental change","1. The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.","MA206","PT","","",""
"Repeatability of feather mite prevalence and intensity in passerine birds","Understanding why host species differ so much in symbiont loads and how this depends on ecological host and symbiont traits is a major issue in the ecology of symbiosis. A first step in this inquiry is to know whether observed differences among host species are species-specific traits or more related with host-symbiont environmental conditions. Here we analysed the repeatability (R) of the intensity and the prevalence of feather mites to partition within- and among-host species variance components. We compiled the largest dataset so far available: 119 Paleartic passerine bird species, 75,944 individual birds, ca. 1.8 million mites, seven countries, 23 study years. Several analyses and approaches were made to estimate R and adjusted repeatability (Radj) after controlling for potential confounding factors (breeding period, weather, habitat, spatial autocorrelation and researcher identity). The prevalence of feather mites was moderately repeatable (R = 0.26-0.53; Radj = 0.32-0.57); smaller values were found for intensity (R = 0.19-0.30; Radj = 0.18-0.30). These moderate repeatabilities show that prevalence and intensity of feather mites differ among species, but also that the high variation within species leads to considerable overlap among bird species. Differences in the prevalence and intensity of feather mites within bird species were small among habitats, suggesting that local factors are playing a secondary role. However, effects of local climatic conditions were partially observed for intensity.  2014 Diaz-Real et al.

"Social network theory: new insights and issues for behavioral ecologists","Until recently, few studies have used social network theory (SNT) and metrics to examine how social network structure (SNS) might influence social behavior and social dynamics in non-human animals. Here, we present an overview of why and how the social network approach might be useful for behavioral ecology. We first note four important aspects of SNS that are commonly observed, but relatively rarely quantified: (1) that within a social group, differences among individuals in their social experiences and connections affect individual and group outcomes; (2) that indirect connections can be important (e.g., partners of your partners matter); (3) that individuals differ in their importance in the social network (some can be considered keystone individuals); and (4) that social network traits often carry over across contexts (e.g., SN position in male-male competition can influence later male mating success). We then discuss how these four points, and the social network approach in general, can yield new insights and questions for a broad range of issues in behavioral ecology including: mate choice, alternative mating tactics, male-male competition, cooperation, reciprocal altruism, eavesdropping, kin selection, dominance hierarchies, social learning, information flow, social foraging, and cooperative antipredator behavior. Finally, we suggest future directions including: (1) integrating behavioral syndromes and SNT; (2) comparing space use and SNS; (3) adaptive partner choice and SNS; (4) the dynamics and stability (or instability) of social networks, and (5) group selection shaping SNS.","MA337","PT","","",""
"Comparing environmental impacts for livestock products: A review of life cycle assessments","Livestock production has a major impact on the environment. Choosing a more environmentally-friendly livestock product in a diet can mitigate environmental impact. The objective of this research was to compare assessments of the environmental impact of livestock products. Twenty-five peer-reviewed studies were found that assessed the impact of production of pork, chicken, beef, milk, and eggs using life cycle analysis (LCA). Only 16 of these studies were reviewed, based on five criteria: study from an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) country, non-organic production, type of LCA methodology, allocation method used, and definition of system boundary. LCA results of these 16 studies were expressed in three ways: per kg product, per kg protein, and per kg of average daily intake of each product for an OECD country. The review yielded a consistent ranging of results for use of land and energy, and for climate change. No clear pattern was found, however, for eutrophication and acidification. Production of 1 kg of beef used most land and energy, and had highest global warming potential (GWP), followed by production of 1 kg of pork, chicken, eggs, and milk. Differences in environmental impact among pork, chicken, and beef can be explained mainly by 3 factors: differences in feed efficiency, differences in enteric CH4 emission between monogastric animals and ruminants, and differences in reproduction rates. The impact of production of 1 kg of meat (pork, chicken, beef) was high compared with production of 1 kg of milk and eggs because of the relatively high water content of milk and eggs. Production of 1 kg of beef protein also had the highest impact, followed by pork protein, whereas chicken protein had the lowest impact. This result also explained why consumption of beef was responsible for the largest part of the land use and GWP in an average OECD diet. This review did not show consistent differences in environmental impact per kg protein in milk, pork, chicken and eggs. Only one study compared environmental impact of meat versus milk and eggs. Conclusions regarding impact of pork or chicken versus impact of milk or eggs require additional comparative studies and further harmonization of LCA methodology. Interpretation of current LCA results for livestock products, moreover, is hindered because results do not include environmental consequences of competition for land between humans and animals, and consequences of land-use changes. We recommend, therefore, to include these consequences in future LCAs of livestock products.  2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","MA59","PT","","",""
"High diversity and low genetic structure of feather mites associated with a phenotypically variable bird host","Obligate symbionts may be genetically structured among host individuals and among phenotypically distinct host populations. Such processes may in turn determine within-host genetic diversity of symbionts, which is relevant for understanding symbiont population dynamics. We analysed the population genetic structure of two species of feather mites (Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata) in migratory and resident blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla that winter sympatrically. Resident and migratory hosts may provide mites with habitats of different qualities, what might promote specialization of mite populations. We found high genetic diversity of within-host populations for both mite species, but no sign of genetic structure of mites between migratory and resident hosts. Our results suggest that, although dispersal mechanisms between hosts during the non-breeding season are unclear, mite populations are not limited by transmission bottlenecks that would reduce genetic diversity among individuals that share a host. Additionally, there is no evidence that host phenotypic divergence (associated with the evolution of migration and residency) has promoted the evolution of host-specialist mite populations. Unrestricted dispersal among host types may allow symbiotic organisms to avoid inbreeding and to persist in the face of habitat heterogeneity in phenotypically diverse host populations.

"Sperm storage reflects within- and extra-pair mating opportunities in a cooperatively breeding bird","In passerine birds, storage and maturation of sperm takes place in the cloacal protuberance (CP), an external swelling of the reproductive organ. The considerable variation in CP size among species is presumed to be a consequence of varying levels of sperm-competition, but whether individual variation in CP size within a species also reflects sperm competition is not well established. Here, we study temporal variation in male CP size in relation to within-pair and extra-pair mating opportunities and cuckoldry risk in purple-crowned fairy-wrens Malurus coronatus. This is a socially monogamous cooperatively breeding passerine that can breed year-round and has low levels of extra-pair paternity (in 6 \% of broods). We show that male CP size sharply increased a few weeks before, and rapidly regressed after his partner laid eggs, consistent with a cost of its maintenance and/or sperm production. Surprisingly, despite low levels of extra-pair paternity, CP size of non-breeding and pre-breeding males was positively correlated with the number of breeding females in the population, suggesting that CP size is sensitive to extra-pair mating opportunities. However, CP sizes do not seem to reflect cuckoldry risk: CP size of dominant males was unaffected by the presence of a subordinate that was unrelated to the dominant female, although those subordinates occasionally sire offspring, and had a larger CP than subordinates living with their mother. Our results suggest that, even in a species with low levels of extra-pair paternity, individual investment in sperm storage reflects both within-pair and, albeit to lesser extent, extra-pair mating opportunities.","MA348","PT","","",""
"Viral quasispecies profiles as the result of the interplay of competition and cooperation","Background. Viral quasispecies can be regarded as a swarm of genetically related mutants. A common approach employed to describe viral quasispecies is by means of the quasispecies equation (QE). However, a main criticism of QE is its lack of frequency-dependent selection. This can be overcome by an alternative formulation for the evolutionary dynamics: the replicator-mutator equation (RME). In turn, a problem with the RME is how to quantify the interaction coefficients between viral variants. Here, this is addressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche theory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of resources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing individuals (the different viral variants that constitute the quasispecies). This provides a theoretical framework to estimate quantitatively the fitness landscape. Results. Using this novel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping for describing a quasispecies we explore the population distributions of viral variants that emerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics. We observe that the population distribution requires very long transients both to A) reach equilibrium and B) to show a clear dominating master sequence. Based on different independent and recent experimental evidence, we find that when some cooperation or facilitation between variants is included in appropriate doses we can solve both A) and B). We show that a useful quantity to calibrate the degree of cooperation is the Shannon entropy. Conclusions. In order to get a typical quasispecies profile, at least within the considered mathematical approach, it seems that pure competition is not enough. Some dose of cooperation among viral variants is needed. This has several biological implications that might contribute to shed light on the mechanisms operating in quasispecies dynamics and to understand the quasispecies as a whole entity.  2010 Arbiza et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","MA406","PT","","",""
"From species to individuals: does the variation in ant-plant networks scale result in structural and functional changes?","Predicting the outcomes of any mutualistic interaction between ants and plants can be a very difficult task, since these outcomes are often determined by the ecological context in which the interacting species are embedded. Network theory has been an important tool to improve our understanding about the organizational patterns of animal-plant interactions. Nevertheless, traditionally, network studies have focused mainly on species-based differences and ignoring the importance of individual differences within populations. In this study, we evaluated if downscaling an ant-plant network from species to the individual level results in structural and functional changes in a network involving different-sized plant individuals. For this, we studied the extrafloral-nectar producing-tree Caryocar brasiliense (Caryocaraceae) and their associated ants in a Neotropical savanna. We observed 254 interactions involving 43 individuals of C. brasiliense and 47 ant species. The individual-based ant-plant network exhibited a nested pattern of interactions, with all developmental stages contributing equally to structuring this non-random pattern. We also found that plants with greater centrality within the network were better protected by their ant partners. However, plants with higher levels of individual specialization were not necessarily better protected by ants. Overall, we presented empirical evidence that intra-population variations are important for shaping ant-plant networks, since they can change the level of protection against herbivores conferred by the ants. These results highlight the importance of individual-based analyses of ecological networks, opening new research venues in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of ant-plant interactions.","MA159","PT","","",""

"Potential for endophyte symbiosis to increase resistance of the native grass Poa alsodes to invasion by the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum","Microbial symbionts can improve the competitive ability and stress tolerance of plant hosts and thus may enhance native plant resistance against invaders. We investigated whether symbiosis between a native grass, Poa alsodes, and a fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) improved the grass's ability to compete against Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a common invader in the eastern USA. We challenged naturally endophyte-symbiotic and experimentally endophyte-free P. alsodes plants with the invader. In the first experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and water availability to test for context-dependency in symbiont benefits. In the second experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and M. vimineum diversity (the number of invader populations), since greater intraspecific diversity is expected to improve invasion success and might alter the efficacy of symbiosis in invasion resistance. In both experiments, presence of the endophyte reduced the per plant biomass of M. vimineum and increased P. alsodes biomass. We found no evidence that benefits of the symbiont depended on water availability, and population-level diversity had a minor influence on M. vimineum: inflorescence number showed a parabolic relationship with increasing numbers of M. vimineum populations. Overall, symbiosis in the native grass had stronger effects on invader growth than either water availability or invader genetic diversity. Our results suggest that endophyte symbioses in native plants can increase host performance against an invader, although this conclusion needs confirmation in more complex field settings where other important factors, such as herbivores and fluctuating abiotic conditions, come into play.

"Mating strategies and aggressive combat in wingless neotropical fig wasp males","The aim of this work was to study the wingless males of pollinating (Pegoscapus tonduzi) and two nonpollinating fig wasp species, genus Idarnes, associated with figs (Ficus citrifolia) in Brazil to answer the following questions: 1) Do wingless males of Idarnes spp. and P. tonduzi show different male-male competition strategies?; and, 2) Do the injury within-species variables correlate with fig/population features? Consistently higher injury levels were observed in the two species of Idarnes than in the pollinator species. The results suggested that aggressive confrontations were involved in the mating strategies of Idarnes, whereas non-aggressive strategies were shown by males of P. tonduzi. Generally, injury variables in Idarnes spp. correlated positively with the male encounter rate and negatively with the fig size, thus supporting the contest competition theory. The results pointed out that different species under similar local conditions might follow distinct evolutionary histories. Within species, natural-history particularities might have some influence upon quantified injury levels in wingless males.","MA241","PT","","",""
"The role of frugivory in the diversification of bats in the Neotropics","Aim Ecological interactions are among the most important biotic factors influencing the processes of speciation and extinction. Our aim was to test whether diversification rates of New World Noctilionoidea bats are associated with specialization for frugivory, and how this pattern differs between the mainland and the West Indies. Location The New World. Methods We reconstructed a time-calibrated molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the New World genera of the superfamily Noctilionoidea. We compiled data on diet, morphology, geographical distribution and number of ecoregions in which each genus occurs. Then, using the phylogenetic tree constructed, we tested whether diversification was driven by diet (animalivorous and sanguinivorous versus nectarivorous and frugivorous) and specialization for frugivory. Afterwards, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify correlates of species richness and net diversification rates. Results The diversification rate was higher in mutualistic than in antagonistic clades in mainland and Antillean biogeographical scenarios, but only strictly frugivorous clades showed a markedly higher diversification rate than the rest of the genera. Geographical range and number of ecoregions were positively associated with species richness and diversification rate in continental and insular lineages. Lower body mass, lower forearm length and specialization for frugivory were significantly positively correlated with higher diversification rates in continental lineages, whereas these parameters were negatively correlated in Antillean lineages. Main conclusions The direction of the relationship of intrinsic factors (specialization for frugivory and body size) with diversification of noctilionoid bats depends on the biogeographical context, whereas the direction of the relationship of extrinsic factors (geographical range and number of ecoregions) with diversification is consistent in both mainland and the West Indian lineages.","MA385","PT","","",""
"Identification, typing, and insecticidal activity of Xenorhabdus isolates from entomopathogenic nematodes in United Kingdom soil and characterization of the xpt toxin loci","Xenorhabdus strains from entomopathogenic nematodes isolated from United Kingdom soils by using the insect bait entrapment method were characterized by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, four housekeeping genes (asd, ompR, recA, and serC) and the flagellin gene (fliC). Most strains (191/197) were found to have genes with greatest similarity to those of Xenorhabdus bovienii, and the remaining six strains had genes most similar to those of Xenorhabdus nematophila. Generally, 16S rRNA sequences and the sequence types based on housekeeping genes were in agreement, with a few notable exceptions. Statistical analysis implied that recombination had occurred at the serC locus and that moderate amounts of interallele recombination had also taken place. Surprisingly, the fliC locus contained a highly variable central region, even though insects lack an adaptive immune response, which is thought to drive flagellar variation in pathogens of higher organisms. All the X. nematophila strains exhibited a consistent pattern of insecticidal activity, and all contained the insecticidal toxin genes xptA1A2B1C1, which were present on a pathogenicity island (PAI). The PAIs were similar among the X. nematophila strains, except for partial deletions of a peptide synthetase gene and the presence of insertion sequences. Comparison of the PAI locus with that of X. bovienii suggested that the PAI integrated into the genome first and then acquired the xpt genes. The independent mobility of xpt genes was further supported by the presence of xpt genes in X. bovienii strain 173 on a type 2 transposon structure and by the variable patterns of insecticidal activity in X. bovienii isolates, even among closely related strains.

"A control process model of code-switching","Code-switching (CS) is central to many bilingual communities and, though linguistic and sociolinguistic research has characterised different types of code-switches (alternations, insertions, dense CS), the cognitive control processes (CPs) that mediate them are not well understood. A key issue is how during CS speakers produce the right words in the right order. In speech, serial order emerges from a speech plan in which items are represented in parallel. We propose that entry into the mechanism for speech planning (a competitive queuing mechanism) is governed by CPs best suited to the particular types of code-switches. Language task schemas external to the language network govern access. In CS, they are coordinated cooperatively and operate in a coupled or in an open control mode. The former permits alternations and insertions whereas the latter is required for dense CS. We explore predictions of this CP model and its implications for CS research.","MA3","PT","","",""
"Studies of the social ecology of Norwegian killer whales (Orcinus orca)","Killer whales along the Norwegian coast have been studied since 1990 with methods based on photo-identification. Preliminary insights of the social characteristics of Norwegian killer whales are presented generally. About 400 killer whales are identified, and 65% of the whales have been resighted. The whales occur in groups of moderate sizes, all containing adult males and breeding females. The groups seem to be social units based at least partly on stable membership. Acoustic analyses revealed both uniqueness and a variable degree of similarity in the vocalization of different groups of whales. The social integrity of groups is further indicated by cooperative feeding on herring, communal care of young, competitive interactions between groups and specialized feeding on marine mammals by one small group of whales. Some adult males have a nomadic occurrence, and, might eventually represent a mating strategy. Ritualized interactions between males appear to be affiliation acts. Large males and female-sized whales do not seem to differentiate in diving behaviour during cooperative feeding due to synchrony in respiration patterns. Norwegian killer whales eresemble the well-studied Canadian killer whales, but there are also indications of some intraspecific variability.  1995, Elsevier B.V.

"Coflowering Community Context Influences Female Fitness and Alters the Adaptive Value of Flower Longevity in Mimulus guttatus","A major goal in evolutionary biology is to incorporate the complexity of multispecies interactions into our understanding of microevolutionary processes within populations. Although considerable work has been done on antagonistic interactions (e.g., plant-herbivore), little attention has been paid to the evolutionary implications of context dependency in mutualistic interactions (e.g., plant-pollinator). In this study, we use seep communities to evaluate how coflowering species richness affects key aspects of pollination (visitation rate and conspecific and heterospecific pollen receipt) of Mimulus guttatus. We assessed the importance of coflowering diversity in mediating floral evolution by determining whether species richness was associated with variation in flower size, longevity, and stigma-anther distance and by conducting a reciprocal transplant experiment in two contrasting pollination environments. We found lower visitation rates and higher heterospecific pollen transfer to M. guttatus growing in high-diversity coflowering communities compared to low-diversity coflowering communities. We found a positive correlation between flower longevity and coflowering species richness. Furthermore, our reciprocal transplant experiment showed that extended flower longevity was advantageous only in high-diversity seeps and identified coflowering diversity as the most likely selective agent. Our results suggest that coflowering diversity can promote floral trait differentiation among populations, in this case, flower longevity.","MA50","PT","","",""
"Investigating the causes and consequences of symbiont shuffling in a multi-partner reef coral symbiosis under environmental change","Dynamic symbioses may critically mediate impacts of climate change on diverse organisms, with repercussions for ecosystem persistence in some cases. On coral reefs, increases in heat-tolerant symbionts after thermal bleaching can reduce coral susceptibility to future stress. However, the relevance of this adaptive response is equivocal owing to conflicting reports of symbiont stability and change.We help reconcile this conflict by showing that change in symbiont community composition (symbiont shuffling) in Orbicella faveolata depends on the disturbance severity and recovery environment. The proportion of heat-tolerant symbionts dramatically increased following severe experimental bleaching, especially in a warmer recovery environment, but tended to decrease if bleaching was less severe. These patterns can be explained by variation in symbiont performance in the changing microenvironments created by differentially bleached host tissues. Furthermore, higher proportions of heat-tolerant symbionts linearly increased bleaching resistance but reduced photochemical efficiency, suggesting that any change in community structure oppositely impacts performance and stress tolerance. Therefore, even minor symbiont shuffling can adaptively benefit corals, although fitness effects of resulting trade-offs are difficult to predict. This work helps elucidate causes and consequences of dynamism in symbiosis, which is critical to predicting responses of multi-partner symbioses such as O. faveolata to environmental change.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"The cost of myrmecophytism: Insights from allometry of stem secondary growth","Background and AimsPlant defence traits against herbivores incur production costs that are usually difficult to measure. However, estimating these costs is a prerequisite for characterizing the plant defence strategy as a whole. Myrmecophytes are plants that provide symbiotic ants with specialized nesting cavities, called domatia, in exchange for protection against herbivores. In the particular case of stem domatia, production of extra wood seems to be the only associated cost, making this indirect defence trait a particularly suitable model for estimating the cost of defence. MethodsMeasurements were made of growth pattern and cumulative production cost of domatia over secondary growth in the myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana subsp. africana, whose internodes display both a solid basal segment and a hollow distal part (the domatium), thus allowing paired comparison of investment in wood. Key ResultsPrevious studies showed that 'overconstruction' of the hollow part of internodes during primary growth is needed for mechanical support. In this study, it is shown that the relationship between the woody cross-sectional area of the solid and hollow parts of internodes is negatively allometric at the beginning of secondary growth and nearly isometric later on. Thus, in hollow stems, the first phase of slow secondary growth compensates for the 'overconstruction' of the ring of wood during primary growth. Moreover, the cumulative production cost of a domatium (estimated as the additional volume of wood required for a hollow stem compared with a solid one) is very high at the beginning of secondary growth and then quickly tends to zero. ConclusionsMaking domatia incurs high costs early in ontogeny, costs that are then amortized later in development of stems and of individual plants. Characterizing ontogenetic variation of the net cost of this peculiar defence mechanism will help us build more accurate theoretical models of resource allocation in myrmecophytes.  2012 The Author.","MA366","PT","","",""
"Competing for seed dispersal: evidence for the role of avian seed hoarders in mediating apparent predation among oaks","In communities of large-seeded tree species, generalist seed hoarders often link the temporally variable dynamics of various species in ways that can result in indirect ecological interactions. A special case of such interactions is apparent predation' - when variation in seed production of one tree species changes the outcome of the interaction between seed hoarders and another tree species from seed dispersal mutualism to predation. We investigated how two species of avian hoarders responded to differences in acorn availability among individual valley oaks (Quercus lobata) and across a landscape dominated by blue oaks (Q.douglasii) to determine whether seed dispersal and predation dynamics result in apparent predation between these oak species. California scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica), high-quality seed dispersers with large spatial scales of resource perception, showed strong numerical and functional responses to individually large Q.lobata acorn crops when landscape-level acorn crops were low, but the numerical response was not observed when Q.douglasii produced a good acorn crop the subsequent year. In contrast, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), which are significant acorn predators, exhibited a consistent functional response to individual Q.lobata acorn crops independent of landscape-wide availability. Consequently, Q.lobata experienced increased predation and a near absence of high-quality seed dispersal when Q.douglasii acorns were abundant. Our results suggest that apparent predation among oak species can arise from contrasting responses of generalist seed predators and dispersers to acorn availability on different spatial scales. Thus, the spatial scale of resource perception, which can differ greatly among generalist seed hoarders, may provide a proximate mechanism underlying indirect, temporally variable ecological affects such as apparent predation among sympatric species of large-seeded trees.","MA60","PT","","",""
"All signals are not equal: acoustic signalling of individuality, sex and breeding status in a cooperative breeder","Repeated interactions between individuals in socially living animals select for the evolution of signals that convey information identifying individuals or categories of individuals, which may enable the discrimination of familiar versus unfamiliar individuals. Such information may help animals maximize their inclusive fitness by adjusting their own behaviour, allowing them to avoid conflict, preferentially direct help and/or ignore unreliable individuals. Acoustic signals in birds provide the potential to encode individual-specific information. We examined the degree to which individual identity, sex, breeding status, group membership and genetic relatedness were related to variability in six different call types, which occurred across a variety of different behavioural contexts in the apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea, a socially living and cooperatively breeding Australian passerine. We demonstrated that not all calls reflected the same extent of information. Of the six call types, call variation was related to individual identity in three call types, breeding status in two call types and sex and group relatedness in one call type. Finally, variation in two call types was not related to any of the measured variables. Our results suggest that some, but not all, acoustic signals in apostlebirds may be selected for individual distinctiveness between individuals and categories of individuals (male versus female, breeder versus nonbreeder), and these signals may be important in determining levels of cooperation and interaction between individuals in this cooperatively breeding society.

"Adaptations to endosymbiosis in a Cnidarian-Dinoflagellate association: Differential gene expression and specific gene duplications","Trophic endosymbiosis between anthozoans and photosynthetic dinoflagellates forms the key foundation of reef ecosystems. Dysfunction and collapse of symbiosis lead to bleaching (symbiont expulsion), which is responsible for the severe worldwide decline of coral reefs. Molecular signals are central to the stability of this partnership and are therefore closely related to coral health. To decipher inter-partner signaling, we developed genomic resources (cDNA library and microarrays) from the symbiotic sea anemone Anemonia viridis. Here we describe differential expression between symbiotic (also called zooxanthellate anemones) or aposymbiotic (also called bleached) A. viridis specimens, using microarray hybridizations and qPCR experiments. We mapped, for the first time, transcript abundance separately in the epidermal cell layer and the gastrodermal cells that host photosynthetic symbionts. Transcriptomic profiles showed large inter-individual variability, indicating that aposymbiosis could be induced by different pathways. We defined a restricted subset of 39 common genes that are characteristic of the symbiotic or aposymbiotic states. We demonstrated that transcription of many genes belonging to this set is specifically enhanced in the symbiotic cells (gastroderm). A model is proposed where the aposymbiotic and therefore heterotrophic state triggers vesicular trafficking, whereas the symbiotic and therefore autotrophic state favors metabolic exchanges between host and symbiont. Several genetic pathways were investigated in more detail: i) a key vitamin K-dependant process involved in the dinoflagellate-cnidarian recognition; ii) two cnidarian tissue-specific carbonic anhydrases involved in the carbon transfer from the environment to the intracellular symbionts; iii) host collagen synthesis, mostly supported by the symbiotic tissue. Further, we identified specific gene duplications and showed that the cnidarian-specific isoform was also up-regulated both in the symbiotic state and in the gastroderm. Our results thus offer new insight into the inter-partner signaling required for the physiological mechanisms of the symbiosis that is crucial for coral health.  2011 Ganot et al.","MA9","PT","","",""
"First evidence for the joint dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi and plant diaspores by birds","Seed dispersal allows plants to colonise new sites and escape from pathogens and intraspecific competition, maintaining plant genetic diversity and regulating plant distribution. Conversely, most plant species form mutualistic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a symbiosis established immediately after seed germination. Because AM fungi are obligate symbionts, using the same dispersal vector as their host should be highly advantageous for their survival, but the co-dispersal of seeds and AM fungal spores has never been confirmed. We aim to clarify the potential role of European birds, essential dispersers for many plant species, as co-dispersers of seeds and AM fungal spores. In total, 63 bird droppings with intact seeds were placed in sterilised soil and maintained for 4months in a protected environment to avoid contamination. Additionally, 173 bird droppings and 729 gauze swabs used to clean birds feet were inspected for AM fungal spores. Although no spores were detected by direct observation of these samples, seven Rubus ulmifolius seedlings obtained from four independent droppings of Erithacus rubecula and Sylvia melanocephala were colonised by AM fungi. Our results show that birds can effectively co-disperse viable seeds and AM fungal spores, potentially over long distances, providing a pivotal mechanism to understand the cosmopolitan distribution of AM fungi.  2018 The Authors.

"Collaboration among sponge species increases sponge diversity and abundance in a seagrass meadow","Caribbean sponge species typical of coral reefs are generally inhibited from living in seagrass meadows by their vulnerability to predation by the large starfish Oreaster reticulatus (Linnaeus 1758). Although readily consumed by Oreaster, the conspicuous coral reef sponge species Lissodendoryx colombiensis Zea & van Soest, 1986 has expanded its habitat distribution to include a seagrass (Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Knig, 1805) meadow in Belize, where individuals grow to volumes of nearly 7l. By simple observation, L. colombiensis appears to be an inferior competitor in this system, because portions of many individuals are overgrown by seagrass sponge species. However, experimentally clustering seagrass sponges around L. colombiensis individuals deterred starfish from feeding on them, suggesting an advantage to being overgrown. Sizes of individual L. colombiensis can fluctuate widely over short time intervals, reflecting both a relatively fast growth rate and the high rate at which starfish consume this species. At the population level these fluctuations are not evident, as losses of L. colombiensis due to Oreaster are balanced by a combination of efficient recruitment, rapid regeneration and growth, and protection of portions of many individuals by the overgrowth of seagrass sponge species that are unpalatable to Oreaster . In turn, the seagrass sponges acquire stable perches on L. colombiensis individuals in this sediment-dominated habitat. Community ecology theory relating to diversity patterns in sessile organisms has focused on competition between space-requiring neighbors as the underlying process that inevitably decreases diversity unless curtailed. Sponges, with their propensity for engaging in beneficial interactions with neighbors, demand expansion of the theory to acknowledge how collaboration can increase abundance and species diversity within a community.

"Mining the Plasmodium genome database to define organellar function: What does the apicoplast do?","Apicomplexan species constitute a diverse group of parasitic protozoa, which are responsible for a wide range of diseases in many organisms. Despite differences in the diseases they cause, these parasites share an underlying biology, from the genetic controls used to differentiate through the complex parasite life cycle, to the basic biochemical pathways employed for intracellular survival, to the distinctive cell biology necessary for host cell attachment and invasion. Different parasites lend themselves to the study of different aspects of parasite biology: Eimeria for biochemical studies, Toxoplasma for molecular genetic and cell biological investigation, etc. The Plasmodium falciparum Genome Project contributes the first large-scale genomic sequence for an apicomplexan parasite. The Plasmodium Genome Database (http://PlasmoDB. org) has been designed to permit individual investigators to ask their own questions, even prior to formal release of the reference P. falciparum genome sequence.

"The origins of consistent individual differences in cooperation in wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo","Individual differences in contributions to cooperation can be strikingly consistent over time giving rise to alternative cooperative phenotypes within animal societies. Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as `breeders' and `nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and `escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

"When mutualisms matter: Rhizobia effects on plant communities depend on host plant population and soil nitrogen availability","Mutualistic interactions, such as the relationship between legumes and rhizobia, can affect community properties, yet there needs to be greater understanding of when these interactions may be most important to communities. Resource mutualism theory provides predictions based on variation in abiotic and biotic factors. First, there is substantial intraspecific genetic variation in how legumes interact with rhizobia, including variation in legume growth response to rhizobia, number of rhizobia-housing nodules and nitrogen fixation. Rhizobia likely have greater community impacts when associating with hosts that benefit greatly from rhizobia, produce many nodules and fix a lot of nitrogen. Second, increased soil nutrient availability typically reduces the partner benefits of legume-rhizobium interactions. As a result, the legume-rhizobium resource mutualism may have greater effects on communities in low-nitrogen environments. We first conducted a common garden study of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata to explore intraspecific variation in focal traits related to competition and mutualistic interactions with rhizobia. Then, we manipulated the presence of rhizobia, nitrogen fertilization and population identity of C.fasciculata in mesocosms simulating native plant communities. We measured plant diversity, assessed changes in community composition and measured soil nutrient availability. We detected significant genetically based intraspecific variation in growth and mutualism-related traits across C.fasciculata populations. From the experimental mesocosms, we found that although rhizobia consistently reduced diversity, rhizobia most strongly reduced diversity when associating with C.fasciculata populations that were highly dependent on rhizobia and when nitrogen was most limiting. We also detected greater variation among populations in their effects on communities in the absence of rhizobia; the presence of rhizobia dramatically minimized effects of population identity on the surrounding community.Synthesis. These findings show that abiotic environmental factors and intraspecific variation in a dominant host plant can influence the magnitude of mutualism effects on communities and, reciprocally, how the presence of key mutualists can influence the importance of genetically based variation among populations to community outcomes. While prior studies have detected both strong and weak effects of mutualism on plant communities, our study illustrates that mutualism theory may predict when strong mutualism effects are most likely to occur and also shows how theories developed for particular species interactions may make studies investigating the ecological impacts of genetic variation a more predictive science.","MA409","PT","","",""
"Evolution of dispersal and life history strategies - Tetrahymena ciliates","Background. Considerable attention has focused on how selection on dispersal and other core life-history strategies (reproductive effort, survival ability, colonization capacity) may lead to so-called dispersal syndromes. Studies on genetic variation in these syndromes within species could importantly increase our understanding of their evolution, by revealing whether traits co-vary across genetic lineages in the manner predicted by theoretical models, and by stimulating further hypotheses for experimental testing. Yet such studies remain scarce. Here we studied the ciliated protist Tetrahymena thermophila, a particularly interesting organism due to cells being able to transform into morphs differing dramatically in swim-speed. We investigated dispersal, morphological responses, reproductive performance, and survival in ten different clonal strains. Then, we examined whether life history traits co-varied in the manner classically predicted for ruderal species, examined the investment of different strains into short- and putative long-distance dispersal, while considering also the likely impact of semi-sociality (cell aggregation, secretion of 'growth factors') on dispersal strategies. Results. Very significant among-strain differences were found with regard to dispersal rate, morphological commitment and plasticity, and almost all core life-history traits (e.g. survival, growth performance and strategy), with most of these traits being significantly intercorrelated. Some strains showed high short-distance dispersal rates, high colonization capacity, bigger cell size, elevated growth performance, and good survival abilities. These well performing strains, however, produced fewer fast-swimming dispersal morphs when subjected to environmental degradation than did philopatric strains performing poorly under normal conditions. Conclusion. Strong evidence was found for a genetic covariation between dispersal strategies and core life history traits in T. thermophila, with a fair fit of observed trait associations with classic colonizer models. However, the well performing strains with high colonization success and short-distance dispersal likely suffered under a long-distance dispersal disadvantage, due to producing fewer fast-swimming dispersal morphs than did philopatric strains. The smaller cell size at carrying capacity of the latter strains and their poor capacity to colonize as individual cells suggest that they may be adapted to greater levels of dependency on clone-mates (stronger sociality). In summary, differential exposure to selection on competitive and cooperative abilities, in conjunction with selective factors targeting specifically dispersal distance, likely contributed importantly to shaping T. thermophila dispersal and life history evolution.  2007 Fjerdingstad et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","MA125","PT","","",""
"Handling times and saturating transmission functions in a snailworm symbiosis","All dynamic species interaction models contain an assumption that describes how contact rates scale with population density. Choosing an appropriate contactdensity function is important, because different functions have different implications for population dynamics and stability. However, this choice can be challenging, because there are many possible functions, and most are phenomenological and thus difficult to relate to underlying ecological processes. Using one such phenomenological function, we described a nonlinear relationship between field transmission rates and host density in a common snailoligochaete symbiosis. We then used a well-known contact function from predatorprey models, the Holling Type II functional response, to describe and predict host snail contact rates in the laboratory. The Holling Type II functional response accurately described both the nonlinear contactdensity relationship and the average contact duration that we observed. Therefore, we suggest that contact rates saturate with host density in this system because each snail contact requires a non-instantaneous handling time, and additional possible contacts do not occur during that handling time. Handling times and nonlinear contact rates might also explain the nonlinear relationship between symbiont transmission and snail density that we observed in the field, which could be confirmed by future work that controls for other potential sources of seasonal variation in transmission rates. Because most animal contacts are not instantaneous, the Holling Type II functional response might be broadly relevant to diverse hostsymbiont systems.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","MA172","PT","","",""
"Helping effort in primitively eusocial wasps","In primitively eusocial and cooperatively breeding societies, there is substantial individual variation in helping effort that is not accounted for by variation in genetic relatedness. In primitively eusocial wasps, helpers have a significant chance of inheriting breeding positions. Recent models suggest that because helpers with greater expected future fitness have more to lose, they should invest less in rearing the dominant's offspring. Observations and experiments on the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata support this prediction: helpers nearer to the front of the queue to inherit dominance, and helpers that stand to inherit larger, more productive groups, work less hard. These findings support the view that variation in social traits is best understood from a life-history perspective. Group augmentation effects, where greater helping effort leads to direct benefits through increased group size, seem less important in wasps. Further studies are required to understand how conflicts over helping effort are resolved in social wasps.  Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.","MA174","PT","","",""
"Wolbachia requirement for oogenesis: occurrence within the genus Asobara (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) and evidence for intraspecific variation in A-tabida","Wolbachia are symbiotic bacteria that induce a diversity of phenotypes on their numerous invertebrate host species. In the wasp Asobara tabida (Braconidae), each individual harbours three Wolbachia strains: wAtab3, which is required for host oogenesis, and wAtab1 and wAtab2, that do not have this function but induce cytoplasmic incompatibility. In this study, we surveyed and identified Wolbachia strains in four additional Asobara species. We detected Wolbachia in one of these species, but both the identity ( based on wsp gene) and prevalence of the Wolbachia detected in natural population indicate that this host species is not dependent on Wolbachia for oogenesis. We also compared A. tabida lines of different geographical origin for their dependence on Wolbachia. All individuals from 16 A. tabida lines proved to be infected by the three Wolbachia strains wAtab1, wAtab2 and wAtab3, but, interestingly, we found variation among lines in the degree to which females were dependent on Wolbachia to produce their oocytes. In three lines, aposymbiotic females ( cured from the three Wolbachia strains by antibiotics) can produce some oocytes. However, these aposymbiotic females produce fewer and smaller oocytes than symbiotic ones, and the larvae they produce die before full development. Thus, depending on which nuclear genotype they have, A. tabida females depend on Wolbachia either because they fail to produce any oocyte or because the few oocytes they do produce generate unviable offspring. We discuss the implications of these findings for the understanding of the physiological and genetic deficiency of aposymbiotic females.","MA411","PT","","",""
"Root Herbivore Effects on Aboveground Multitrophic Interactions: Patterns, Processes and Mechanisms","In terrestrial food webs, the study of multitrophic interactions traditionally has focused on organisms that share a common domain, mainly above ground. In the last two decades, it has become clear that to further understand multitrophic interactions, the barrier between the belowground and aboveground domains has to be crossed. Belowground organisms that are intimately associated with the roots of terrestrial plants can influence the levels of primary and secondary chemistry and biomass of aboveground plant parts. These changes, in turn, influence the growth, development, and survival of aboveground insect herbivores. The discovery that soil organisms, which are usually out of sight and out of mind, can affect plant-herbivore interactions aboveground raised the question if and how higher trophic level organisms, such as carnivores, could be influenced. At present, the study of above-belowground interactions is evolving from interactions between organisms directly associated with the plant roots and shoots (e.g., root feeders - plant - foliar herbivores) to interactions involving members of higher trophic levels (e.g., parasitoids), as well as non-herbivorous organisms (e.g., decomposers, symbiotic plant mutualists, and pollinators). This multitrophic approach linking above- and belowground food webs aims at addressing interactions between plants, herbivores, and carnivores in a more realistic community setting. The ultimate goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of species in communities and, ultimately how community interactions contribute to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we summarize studies on the effects of root feeders on aboveground insect herbivores and parasitoids and discuss if there are common trends. We discuss the mechanisms that have been reported to mediate these effects, from changes in concentrations of plant nutritional quality and secondary chemistry to defense signaling. Finally, we discuss how the traditional framework of fixed paired combinations of root- and shoot-related organisms feeding on a common plant can be transformed into a more dynamic and realistic framework that incorporates community variation in species, densities, space and time, in order to gain further insight in this exciting and rapidly developing field.","MA312","PT","","",""
"Cooperation and conflict in ant foundress associations: insights from geographical variation","Sociality can promote both cooperation and competition. although we assume social organisms possess adaptations that allow them to form groups and deal with within-group conflicts, these are often subtle and difficult to detect. Using a simple form of sociality displayed by young ant foundresses of the desert-seed-harvester ant, Messor pergandei, as a model system, I exploited intraspecific geographic variation in social behaviour to investigate how the social, context has altered individual behavioural strategies. I created social groups composed of two normally nonsocial foundresses, normally social foundresses and mixed groups, and compared foundresses' aggression and willingness to invest resources towards colony productivity. Nonsocial foundresses, presumably not adapted to social life, invested significantly more resources into colony growth than normally social foundresses, and experienced reduced survivorship in mixed groups. In contrast, social foundresses displayed two novel competitive behavioural strategies when confronted with nonsocial partners: retaliatory aggression and egg consumption. These results document that the evolution of social behaviour, rather than promoting cooperation, is driven by the evolution of competitive;e strategies designed to exploit group members and reduce the risk of being exploited by others.

"Gastropod shell size and morphology influence conspecific interactions in an encrusting hydroid","Discrete patches of suitable habitat and the consequent aggregation of organisms with similar habitat requirements often intensify competition, particularly among conspecifics. Habitat differences may generate interactions between smaller or larger individuals at variable stages of development in many fungi, plants, and colonial animals. Size-dependent competitive outcomes and effects on sexual reproductive allocation indicate that differences among discrete habitats have potentially profound ecological and evolutionary implications. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the colonial hydroid Hydractinia {[}GM] colonizes hermit crab-occupied gastropod shells (= microhabitats), which vary greatly in size and morphology. Here, the relationship between the gastropod assemblages available for H. {[}GM] colonization and the frequency of conspecific encounters and sexual status of those colonies involved is documented. Field-collected shells bore 1 to 3 colonies, and the number of colonies per shell increased with shell size. In contrast to previous studies, conspecific encounters were not limited to juvenile colonies. Sexually mature H. {[}GM] colonies generally were not distributed differently among shells with and without conspecifics. Moreover, mature colonies predominated conspecific encounters on large shell species exhibiting certain morphology. Inanimate structures, such as dock pilings and rocky surfaces, provide additional large surfaces for Hydractinia colonization in some areas. These results suggest that previous Hydractinia spp. studies represent only a subset of the diversity of ecologically relevant possibilities with respect to available substrata. Also, the characteristics of a given microhabitat (e.g. shell) affect competitive outcomes and sexual reproductive characters of its constituent competitors.","MA161","PT","","",""
"Comparative Genomics of a Plant-Parasitic Nematode Endosymbiont Suggest a Role in Nutritional Symbiosis","Bacterial mutualists can modulate the biochemical capacity of animals. Highly coevolved nutritional mutualists do this by synthesizing nutrients missing from the host's diet. Genomics tools have advanced the study of these partnerships. Here we examined the endosymbiont Xiphinematobacter (phylum Verrucomicrobia) from the dagger nematode Xiphinema americanum, a migratory ectoparasite of numerous crops that also vectors nepovirus. Previously, this endosymbiont was identified in the gut, ovaries, and eggs, but its role was unknown. We explored the potential role of this symbiont using fluorescence in situ hybridization, genome sequencing, and comparative functional genomics. We report the first genome of an intracellular Verrucomicrobium and the first exclusively intracellular non-Woibachia nematode symbiont. Results revealed that Xiphinematobacter had a small 0.916-Mb genome with only 817 predicted proteins, resembling genomes of other mutualist endosymbionts. Compared with free-living relatives, conserved proteins were shorter on average, and there was large-scale loss of regulatory pathways. Despite massive gene loss, more genes were retained for biosynthesis of amino acids predicted to be essential to the host. Gene ontology enrichment tests showed enrichment for biosynthesis of arginine, histidine, and aromatic amino acids, as well as thiamine and coenzyme A, diverging from the profiles of relatives Akkermansia muciniphilia (in the human colon), Methylacidiphilum infemorum, and the mutualist Wolbachia from filarial nematodes. Together, these features and the location in the gut suggest that Xiphinematobacter functions as a nutritional mutualist, supplementing essential nutrients that are depleted in the nematode diet. This pattern points to evolutionary convergence with endosymbionts found in sap-feeding insects.","MA58","PT","","",""
"Independent effects of arbuscular mycorrhiza and earthworms on plant diversity and newcomer plant establishment","Questions: How do arbuscular mycorrhiza and earthworms affect the structure and diversity of a ruderal plant community? Is the establishment success of newcomer plants enhanced by these soil organisms and their interactions? Methods: We grew a native ruderal plant community composed of different functional groups (grasses, legumes and forbs) in the presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and endogeic earthworms in mesocosms. We introduced seeds of five, mainly exotic, plant species from the same functional groups after a disturbance simulating mowing. The effects of the soil organisms on the native ruderal plant community and seedling establishment of the newcomer plants were assessed. Results: After disturbance, the total above-ground regrowth of the native plant community was not affected by the soil organisms. However, AMF increased plant diversity and shoot biomass of forbs, but decreased shoot biomass of grasses of the native plant community. Earthworms led to a reduction in total root biomass. Establishment of the introduced newcomer plants increased in the presence of AMF and earthworms. Especially, seedling establishment of the introduced non-native legume Lupinus polyphyllus and the native forb Plantago lanceolata was promoted in the presence of AMF and earthworms, respectively. The endogeic earthworms gained more weight in the presence of AMF and led to increased extraradical AMF hyphal length in soil. However, earthworms did not seem to modify the effect of AMF on the plant community. Conclusion: The present study shows the importance of mutualistic soil organisms in mediating the establishment success of newcomer plants in a native plant community. Mutualistic soil organisms lead to changes in the structure and diversity of the native plant community and might promote newcomer plants, including exotic species.","MA195","PT","","",""
"Factors affecting individual participation in group-level aggression among non-human primates","Group members do not always act cohesively when facing extra-group rivals. When benefits such as group-defence are not monopolizable, it poses an economics problem: who should contribute to public goods and who should freeload? A collective action framework compliments existing theoretical explanations for cooperation, and provides testable hypotheses about group-level behaviour based on individual costs and benefits. Using this approach, we review research on intergroup encounters in non-human primates published over the last 20 years, focusing on participation by different classes of individuals. While food- and mate-defence explain much between-sex variation in participation, rank and reproductive access frequently explain within-sex variation. In some species, individuals may use intergroup interactions to survey potential transfer locations and mating options, which might coincidently intimidate rivals. Experimental evidence suggests that when intergroup dominance is based on relative number of fighters, individual participation still varies with sex, rank, companion behaviour and dependent offspring presence. Relatively few studies have examined how factors such as relationships within and between groups or individual temperament mediate aggression. Long-term studies of multiple habituated groups and methodological advances (e.g., playback experiments) will continue to improve our understanding of how complex group-level patterns are predictable when viewed from an individual perspective.  2007 Brill Academic Publishers.","MA138","PT","","",""
"Contrasting effects of Wolbachia on cytoplasmic incompatibility and fecundity in the haplodiploid mite Tetranychus urticae","Recent studies on Wolbachia-induced incompatibility in haplodiploid insects and mites have revealed a diversity of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) patterns among host species. Here, we report intraspecific diversity in CI expression among four strains of the arrhenotokous mite Tetranychus urticae and in T. turkestani. Variability of CI expression within T. urticae ranged from no CI to complete CI, and included either female embryonic mortality or male conversion types of CI. A fecundity cost attributed to the infection with the high-CI Wolbachia strain was the highest ever recorded for Wolbachia (-80 to -100% decrease). Sequence polymorphism at a 550-bp-portion of Wolbachia wsp gene revealed two clusters distant by 21%, one of which included three Wolbachia strains infecting mite populations sampled from the same host-plant species, but showing distinct CI patterns. These data are discussed in the light of theoretical predictions on the evolutionary pathways followed in this symbiotic interaction.","MA74","PT","","",""
"DOES HOST-PLANT QUALITY MEDIATE APHID-ANT MUTUALISM","We investigated the hypothesis that variation in the quality of the host plant (Epilobium angustifolium) mediated the mutualistic interaction between a phloem-feeding homopteran (Aphis varians) and the ant (Formica cinerea) tending it.  First, we used a bioassay to define the quality of Epilobium for A. varians.  We established cohorts of first-instar A. varians on fireweed shoots of different heights.  Development time, size at maturity, and the number and size of embryos per adult were significantly correlated with plant height.  Therefore, plant height provided an indirect measure of plant quality. Second, we experimentally tested the effects of plant height and tending by ants on the growth of aphid populations.  We conducted this experiment in the absence of natural enemies of A. varians in order to examine the direct link between plants, aphids and ants, rather than the indirect links involving the natural enemies of aphids.  As expected, population growth of A. varians on individual Epilobium ramets was positively correlated with plant height.  However, in the absence of natural enemies, the effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations did not vary with plant height.  The absence of an interaction between tending by ants and plant quality was probably due to two processes. First, although there were more ants tending on higher quality host plants, the absolute number of ants tending aphids was low and the increase in the number of ants with increases in plant quality was small.  Second, in the absence of natural enemies and at initial densities of approximately 100 aphids per plant, we were unable to detect a significant effect of ants on the growth of aphid populations. We conclude that host-plant mediation did not occur in this aphid-ant interaction, but we do not know whether this was the result of 1) excluding predators, 2) using initial densities above which ants no longer benefit aphids, 3) the low numbers of ants, or 4) small sample sizes.","MA101","PT","","",""
"Building the microbiome in health and disease: niche construction and social conflict in bacteria","Microbes collectively shape their environment in remarkable ways via the products of their metabolism. The diverse environmental impacts of macro-organisms have been collated and reviewed under the banner of `niche construction'. Here, we identify and review a series of broad and overlapping classes of bacterial niche construction, ranging from biofilm production to detoxification or release of toxins, enzymes, metabolites and viruses, and review their role in shaping microbiome composition, human health and disease. Some bacterial niche-constructing traits can be seen as extended phenotypes, where individuals actively tailor their environment to their benefit (and potentially to the benefit of others, generating social dilemmas). Other modifications can be viewed as non-adaptive by-products from a producer perspective, yet they may lead to remarkable within-host environmental changes. We illustrate how social evolution and niche construction perspectives offer complementary insights into the dynamics and consequences of these traits across distinct timescales. This review highlights that by understanding the coupled bacterial and biochemical dynamics in human health and disease we can better manage host health.","MA37","PT","","",""
"Individual interaction data are required in community ecology: a conceptual review of the predator-prey mass ratio and more","Community ecology is traditionally species-based and assumes that species comprise identical individuals. However, intraspecific variation is ubiquitous in nature because of ontogenetic growth and critical in food-we dynamics. To understand individual interaction-mediated food webs, researchers have recently focused on body size as the most fundamental biological aspect and assessed a parameter called the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). Herein, I review the conceptual development of the PPMR and suggest four major concerns regarding its measurement: (1) PPMR should be measured at the individual level because species-averaged values distort actual feeding relationships, (2) individual-level PPMR data on gape-unconstrained predators (e.g., terrestrial carnivores) are limited because previous studies have targeted gape-limited fish predators, (3) predators' prey size selectivity (preferred PPRM) is conceptually different from dietary prey size (realized PPMR) and should be distinguished by incorporating environmental prey abundance information, and (4) determinants of preferred PPMR, rather than those of realized PPMR, should be identified to describe size-dependent predation. Future studies are encouraged to explore not only predation but also other interaction types (e.g., competition, mutualism, and herbivory) at the individual level. However, this is not likely to occur while ecological communities are still considered to be interspecific interaction networks. To resolve this situation and more comprehensively understand biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, I suggest that community ecology requires a paradigm shift in the unit of interaction from species to individuals, similar to evolutionary biology, which revolutionized the unit of selection, because interactions occur between individuals.","MA199","PT","","",""
"Socially mediated speciation","We employ a simple model to show that social selection can lead to prezygotic reproductive isolation. The evolution of social discrimination causes the congealing of phenotypically similar individuals into different, spatially distinct tribes. However, tribal formation is only obtained for certain types of social behavior: altruistic and selfish acts can produce tribes, whereas spiteful and mutualistic behaviors never do. Moreover, reduced hybrid fitness at tribal borders leads to the selection of mating preferences, which then spread to the core areas of the respective tribes. Unlike models of resource competition, our model generates reproductive isolation in an ecologically homogeneous environment. We elaborate on how altruistic acts can lead to reproductive isolation, but also predict that certain types of competition can lead to the speciation effect. Our theory provides a framework for how individual level interactions mold lineage diversification, with parapatric speciation as a possible end product.","MA338","PT","","",""
"Caterpillar seed predators mediate shifts in selection on flowering phenology in their host plant","Variation in selection among populations and years has important implications for evolutionary trajectories of populations. Yet, the agents of selection causing this variation have rarely been identified. Selection on the time of reproduction within a season in plants might differ both among populations and among years, and selection can be mediated by both mutualists and antagonists. We investigated if differences in the direction of phenotypic selection on flowering phenology among 20 populations of Gentiana pneumonanthe during 2 yr were related to the presence of the butterfly seed predator Phengaris alcon, and if butterfly incidence was associated with the abundance of the butterfly's second host, Myrmica ants. In plant populations without the butterfly, phenotypic selection favored earlier flowering. In populations where the butterfly was present, caterpillars preferentially attacked early-flowering individuals, shifting the direction of selection to favoring later flowering. Butterfly incidence in plant populations increased with ant abundance. Our results demonstrate that antagonistic interactions can shift the direction of selection on flowering phenology, and suggest that such shifts might be associated with differences in the community context.","MA41","PT","","",""
"How to be an ant on figs","Mutualistic interactions are open to exploitation by one or other of the partners and a diversity of other organisms, and hence are best understood as being embedded in a complex network of biotic interactions. Figs participate in an obligate mutualism in that figs are dependent on agaonid fig wasps for pollination and the wasps are dependent on fig ovules for brood sites. Ants are common insect predators and abundant in tropical forests. Ants have been recorded on approximately 11\% of fig species, including all six subgenera, and often affect the fig-fig pollinator interaction through their predation of either pollinating and parasitic wasps. On monoecious figs, ants are often associated with hemipterans, whereas in dioecious figs ants predominantly prey on fig wasps. A few fig species are true myrmecophytes, with domatia or food rewards for ants, and in at least one species this is linked to predation of parasitic fig wasps. Ants also play a role in dispersal of fig seeds and may be particularly important for hemi-epiphytic species, which require high quality establishment microsites in the canopy. The intersection between the fig-fig pollinator and ant-plant systems promises to provide fertile ground for understanding mutualistic interactions within the context of complex interaction networks.

"Under high stakes and uncertainty the rich should lend the poor a helping hand","In social dilemmas, there is tension between individual incentives to optimize personal gain versus social benefits. An additional cause of conflict in such social dilemmas is heterogeneity. Cultural differences or financial inequity often interfere with decision making when a diverse group of individuals interact. We address these issues in situations where individuals are either rich or poor. Often, it is unclear how rich and poor individuals should interact should the poor invest the same as the rich, or should the rich assist the poor? Which distribution of efforts can be considered as fair? To address the effects of heterogeneity on decisions, we model a collective-risk dilemma where players collectively have to invest more than a certain threshold, with heterogeneity and multiple rounds. We aim to understand the natural behavior and to infer which strategies are particularly stable in such asymmetric collective-risk games. Large scale individual based simulations show that when the poor players have half of the wealth the rich players posses, the poor contribute only when early contributions are made by the rich players. The rich contribute on behalf of the poor only when their own external assets are worth protecting. Under a certain degree of uncertainty we observe the rich maintain cooperation by assisting the poor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","MA399","PT","","",""
"Do newborn domestic rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus compete for thermally advantageous positions in the litter huddle?","Competition among mammalian siblings for scarce resources can be severe. Whereas research to date has focused on competition for the mother's milk, the young of many ( particularly altricial) species might also be expected to compete for thermally favorable positions within the nest, den, or litter huddle. We investigated this in newborn pups of the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, a species in which the altricial young are not brooded by the mother, and in which competition for milk is severe. In eight unculled litters (N=86 pups) of a domestic chinchilla strain, we calculated huddling indexes for individual pups on postnatal days 2-5 as a measure of the degree of insulation they received from littermates. Pups maintained almost constant physical contact with the litter huddle. They performed brief but frequent rooting and climbing behaviors, which usually improved their huddling index, interspersed with longer periods of quiescence during which their huddling index declined. As expected, we found a significant positive relation between pups' mean huddling index and body temperature. Unexpectedly, however, we did not find a relation between huddling index and pups' birth weight, survival, milk intake, or efficiency of converting milk to body mass. We conclude that rather than competing for thermally advantageous positions within the huddle newborn rabbits share out thermally advantageous positions as they move in a continual dynamic flow through it. Thus, in newborn rabbits, competition for the mother's milk exists alongside mutual ``cooperative{''} benefits of littermate presence.","MA98","PT","","",""
"Gender- and sequence-dependent predation within group colonizers of defended plants: a constraint on cheating among bark beetles?","Bark beetles engage in one of the most pronounced examples of group procurement of defended plants. Their aggregation pheromones attract both sexes and are essential to overcome constitutive and rapidly inducible lethal defenses. The relative benefits to senders versus receivers of these signals are only partly understood. Because the initial stage of host entry can be hazardous, there may be benefit to a cheating strategy, whose practitioners respond to pheromones but do not engage in host searching. Several disadvantages to cheating have been proposed, but the role of predators has not been considered. Predators exploit bark beetle pheromones to locate prey, accumulate at the breeding site, and consume adult bark beetles before they enter the tree. Preliminary experiments quantified arrival patterns in the field. We used a laboratory assay to investigate relative predation on pioneers (those that initially select and enter hosts) and responders (those that arrive at a host in response to pheromones) during host colonization. Our model system utilized the pine engraver, Ips pini, which exhibits male harem polygamy. We allowed male I. pini to colonize host tissue and added females 1 day later. Also 1 day later, we variably added additional males and predacious checkered beetles, Thanasimus dubius. These treatments included two densities of males and three densities of predators that were selected to emulate field conditions. Responding males experienced higher predation than pioneers. T. dubius ate more males than females, independent of the presence or absence of responding males. T. dubius affected the distribution of females per male, although the number of females that survived to construct ovipositional galleries was constant. We discuss the viability of cheating, implications for biological control, and predator-prey coevolution in this cooperative, group-colonizing herbivore.","MA162","PT","","",""
"Evolution of intra-ejaculate sperm interactions: Do sperm cooperate?","Sperm are often considered to be individuals, in part because of their unique genetic identities produced as a result of synapsis during meiosis, and in part due to their unique ecology, being ejected away from the soma to continue their existence in a foreign environment. Selection at the level of individual sperm has been suggested to explain the evolution of two enigmatic sperm phenotypes: sperm heteromorphism, where more than one type of sperm is produced by a male, and sperm conjugation, where multiple sperm join together for motility and transport through the female reproductive tract before dissociation prior to fertilization. In sperm heteromorphic species, only one of the sperm morphs typically participates in fertilization, with the non-fertilizing ""parasperm"" being interpreted as reproductive altruists. Likewise, in species with sperm conjugation, high levels of sperm mortality have been suggested to be required for conjugate break-up and this has been considered evidence of kin-selected altruism. However, it is unclear if sperm possess the heritable variation in fitness (i.e. are individuals) required for the evolution of cooperation. We investigate the question of sperm individuality by focusing on how sperm morphology is determined and how sperm conjugates are formed. Concentrating on sperm conjugation, we discuss functional hypotheses for the evolutionary maintenance of this remarkable trait. Additionally, we speculate on the potential origins of sperm heteromorphism and conjugation, and explore the diversification and losses of these traits once they have arisen in a lineage. We find current evidence insufficient to support the concept of sperm control over their form or function. Thus, without additional evidence of haploid selection (i.e. sperm phenotypes that reflect their haploid genome and result in heritable differences in fitness), sperm heteromorphism and conjugation should be interpreted not as cooperation but rather as traits selected at the level of the male, much like other ejaculatory traits such as accessory gland proteins and ejaculate size.  2010 The Authors.

"Volatile-mediated location of mutualist host and toxic non-host microfungi by Drosophila larvae","In analogy to herbivores, fungivorous animals may find suitable host fungi using fungal volatiles as infochemicals and to distinguish between fungi of varying suitability. This study tests the influence of volatiles emitted by micro-fungi, yeast and mould, on the foraging behaviour of facultative fungivorous Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We hypothesised that establishing or avoiding contact with edible yeast (host fungus) and inedible, toxic mould (non-host fungus) is regulated by fungus-specific variation in volatile production. In particular, we expected the non-host fungus to produce specific volatiles that repel fly larvae and thus contribute to signal inedibility. By quantifying innate variation in arrival of individual D. melanogaster larvae at colonies of the mutualist yeast Candida californica or of the antagonistic mould Penicillium expansum, we found the yeast to attract more rapidly a larger number of larvae than the mould did. The developmental stage (young, vegetative vs. old, sporulating) of P. expansum did not affect arrival of larvae at fungal colonies. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the composition of fungal volatiles. Four compounds appeared to be yeast-specific, twenty to be mould-specific volatiles. Eight volatiles were consistently produced by both young and old P. expansum. Two compounds, 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-propanol, were released by P. expansum (young and old) as well as C. californica. Time-dependent behavioural response profiles of similar to 750 D. melanogaster larvae revealed innate attraction to three alcohols produced by yeast and/or moulds and to two yeast-specific organic acids. We found no indication of a repellent effect of mould-specific compounds, including terpenoids like geosmin known to elicit strong avoidance behaviour of adult D. melanogaster in response to harmful microbes. Also, synthetic mould and yeast-specific blends of attractive compounds were equally attractive to the larvae. With respect to the species combinations investigated in this study, we hypothesize that qualitative differences in fungal volatile profiles are of minor relevance in how Drosophila larvae locate and probably discriminate between fungi of varying suitability.","MA407","PT","","",""
"Behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology: Unified perspective on personality research","Behavioral geneticists and evolutionary psychologists have generally pursued human behavioral analyses with little theoretical or methodological exchange. However, significant benefits might accrue from increased communication between these disciplines. The primary goals of this article are (1) to identify meaningful junctures between behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology, (2) to describe behavioral genetic research designs and their applications to evolutionary analyses, and (3) to reassess current personality research in light of behavioral genetic and evolutionary concepts and techniques, The five-factor model of personality is conceptualized as subsuming variation in normative species-typical systems with adaptive functions in the human environment of evolutionary adaptation. Considered as universal evolved mechanisms, personality systems are often seen in dynamic conflict within individuals and as highly compartmentalized in their functioning between settings, However, genetically influenced individual differences in personality may also be understood within an evolutionary framework. Studies of the heritability of personality traits indicate broad-sense heritabilities in the 0.40-0.50 range with evidence of substantial nonadditive genetic variation and nonshared environmental influences. Evidence indicates that evolutionary theory (e.g., inclusive fitness theory) predicts patterns of social interaction (e.g., cooperation and bereavement) in relatives. Furthermore, variation in personality may constitute a range of viable strategies matching the opportunities available in the complex niche environment of human societies. Within this wide range of viable strategies, personality variation functions as a resource environment for individuals in the sense that personality variation is evaluated according to the interests of the evaluator (e.g., friendships, coalitions, or mate choice).","MA30","PT","","",""

"Antagonistic interactions among coral-associated bacteria","Reef-building corals are comprised of close associations between the coral animal, symbiotic zooxanthellae, and a diversity of associated microbes (including Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi). Together, these comprise the coral holobiont - a paradigm that emphasizes the potential contributions of each component to the overall function and health of the coral. Little is known about the ecology of the coral-associated microbial community and its hypothesized role in coral health. We explored bacteria-bacteria antagonism among 67 bacterial isolates from the scleractinian coral Montastrea annularis at two temperatures using Burkholder agar diffusion assays. A majority of isolates exhibited inhibitory activity (69.6% of isolates at 25C, 52.2% at 31C), with members of the -proteobacteria (Vibrionales and Alteromonadales) being especially antagonistic. Elevated temperatures generally reduced levels of antagonism, although the effects were complex. Several potential pathogens were observed in the microbial community of apparently healthy corals, and 11.6% of isolates were able to inhibit the growth of the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi at 25C. Overall, this study demonstrates that antagonism could be a structuring force in coral-associated microbial communities and may contribute to pathogenesis as well as disease resistance.  2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","MA19","PT","","",""
"Ectosymbiosis is a critical factor in. the local benthic biodiversity of the Antarctic deep sea","In deep-sea benthic environments, competition for hard substrates is a critical factor in the distribution and diversity of organisms.

We tested this hypothesis at different localities of the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) by Studying the diversity of ectosymbionts living on the spines of cidaroids (echinoids), The presence of cidaroids promoted a higher total specific richness and increased sessile species abundance, but did riot change the diversity. Analyses of species distribution suggested that the cidaroids are a favourable habitat for sessile organisms, compared to rocks, but are colonized by relatively specialist sessile Species, leaving the unfavourable rock habitat to more generalist species. Therefore, our study highlights the role of some living organisms, such as cidaroids, as key species increasing Antarctic benthic deep-sea species richness through the niche they provide to symbiotic species.","MA112","PT","","",""
"Social heterosis and the maintenance of genetic diversity","Genetic diversity in species is often high in spite of directional selection or strong genetic drift. One resolution to this paradox may be through fitness benefits arising from interactions of genetically diverse individuals. Advantageous phenotypes that are impossible in single individuals (e.g. being simultaneously bold and shy) can be expressed by groups composed of genetically different individuals. Genetic diversity, therefore, can produce mutualistic benefits shared by all group members. We define this effect as 'social heterosis', and mathematically demonstrate maintenance of allelic diversity when diverse groups or neighbourhoods are more reproductively successful than homogenous ones. Through social heterosis, genetic diversity persists without: frequency dependence within groups, migration, balancing selection, genetic linkages, overdominance, antagonistic pleiotropy or nonrandom allele assortment. Social heterosis may also offer an alternative evolutionary pathway to cooperation that does not require clustering of related individuals, nepotistic favouritism towards kin, or overt reciprocity.  2007 The Authors.","MA334","PT","","",""

To this end, 53 young adults played blocks of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with each other or with a computer. The environmental context was manipulated across blocks, by introducing uncertainty, randomly losing or gaining money. Individual differences were assessed by participants' attachment style. We found that participants cooperated more when randomly losing money compared to when randomly winning or in the neutral condition. Moreover, in a negative uncertain environment, individuals with higher anxious and avoidant attachment styles cooperated less. The above effects were only observed when playing against a human and not a computer. Overall, the findings highlight the dependency of cooperative behavior on the context as driven by external and internal factors.","MA369","PT","","",""

In this study, our goal was to analyse the morphometric characteristics and relative growth of the carapace of Trapezia bidentata (Forskl, 1775) and T. digitalis Latreille, 1828, crabs from the islands Clipperton and Revillagigedo, in order to assess the degree of inter- and intraspecific similarity of the four insular populations. We examined 325 specimens and identified four species: T. bidentata (72.9% of total abundance), T. digitalis (23.1%), T. formosa Smith, 1869 (3.4%), and T. corallina Gerstaecker, 1857 (0.6%). Three carapace measurements were taken for each specimen: carapace width (CW), carapace length (CL), and interocular distance (ID). The variables CL and ID were fit to a power equation taking CW as the reference dimension. As in other brachyurans, growth pattern analyses indicated an isometric type in all CW vs CL and CW vs ID relationships examined. Interspecific differences included a larger body size for T. bidentata and larger ID/CW for T. digitalis. Significant intraspecific differences in the two insular populations of T. digitalis were evidenced in the ID/CW ratio. In contrast, populations of T. bidentata were morphometrically closer. These results indicate a higher degree of connectedness of the parts of the T. bidentata metapopulation than of that of T. digitalis, probably due to differences in the duration of their larval stages. We think that the larger body size in T. bidentata might account for competitive advantages in food gathering and habitat selection over the remaining species. In turn, as a counteracting trait for its smaller size, the larger ID might allow T. digitalis a better ability to perceive 3D and to judge relative distances between objects, thus avoiding competitive combats and improving antipredatory or escape responses.  2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","MA40","PT","","",""
"Between-group competition, intra-group cooperation and relative performance","We report the results of a new public goods experiment with an intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition. In our design subjects receive information about their relative individual and group performance after each round with non-incentivized and then incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases individual payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with individuals contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the variance of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings increase. These results offer new insights on how social comparison shapes similar reactions in games with different incentives for group performance and how competition and cooperation can influence each other.","MA35","PT","","",""
"Information use and resource competition: An integrative framework","Organisms may reduce uncertainty regarding how best to exploit their environment by collecting information about resource distribution. We develop a model to demonstrate how competition can facilitate or constrain an individuals ability to use information when acquiring resources. As resource distribution underpins both selection on information use and the strength and nature of competition between individuals, we demonstrate interdependencies between the two that should be common in nature. Individuals in our model can search for resources either personally or by using social information. We explore selection on social information use across a comprehensive range of ecological conditions, generalizing the producerscrounger framework to a wide diversity of taxa and resources. We show that resource ecologydefined by scarcity, depletion rate and monopolizabilitydetermines patterns of individual differences in social information use. These differences suggest coevolutionary processes linking dominance systems and social information use, with implications for the evolutionary demography of populations.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Frequency dependence of pollinator visitation rates suggests that pollination niches can allow plant species coexistence","1. How do many species coexist within a trophic level? Resource niches are the classical answer, but in plants which share a small set of abiotic resources, the possibilities for resource partitioning are limited. One possible explanation is that plant species have different pollination niches, with each species specialized to a subset of the available animal species. If this pollinator partitioning results in negative frequency dependence such that each plant species' reproduction is reduced when it becomes abundant, pollination niches could maintain plant diversity, provided that the strength of negative frequency dependence is sufficient to overcome fitness inequalities between species. 2. We tested this idea by quantifying the effect of species relative abundance on pollinator visitation rate in a 7,000 m(2) plot of South African Fynbos vegetation. In addition, we quantified the effect of intraspecific abundance variation at a smaller spatial scale (9 m(2) plots), documented species' pollination niches, and tested the importance of pollinators for seed set in a subset of the plant species. 3. We found that visitation rate indeed declined sharply across the 33 plant species with increasing abundance, but visitation rate was also somewhat depressed in very rare species such that the resulting relationship between visitation rate and relative abundance was hump-shaped. Pollinator niche partitioning among plant species was evident, but less pronounced than in many other studies. Visitation rate was slightly higher in more generalized species, suggesting that they have access to a larger pollination resource. At the intraspecific level and smaller spatial scale, results were less clear and varied among species. Pollinators enhanced seed set in most species. 4. Synthesis. The results imply that, above an abundance threshold, intraspecific competition for pollination could limit the reproduction of common species, thus promoting plant species coexistence. However, the rarest plant species could become extinct due to pollen limitation, that is, an Allee effect. In addition, interactions with pollinators may introduce frequency-independent fitness differences between plant species, thereby increasing the strength of negative frequency dependence required for stable coexistence. These findings shed new light on the role of the pollination niche in plant coexistence.","MA155","PT","","",""
"Turn-taking ceremonies in a colonial seabird: Does behavioral variation signal individual condition?","In species with biparental care, pairs share a cooperative interest in offspring survival but may be in conflict over their relative investments, as reported in recent turn-taking studies of chick-provisioning birds. Turn-taking in Common Murres (Uria aalge) involves the foraging bird returning to the colony to provision the chick and the brooding parent departing. We examined whether Common Murres in poor condition had slower or more irregular turn-taking behavior, as has been documented in Common Murres equipped with geologgers. Irregularities include the brooding bird not trading parental roles with its returning mate or a bird returning to the colony without a fish. Irregular turn-taking sequences generally took longer than normal turn-taking sequences and differed in the rate and synchrony of allopreening, the main interactive behavior between mates. There was a delayed onset of allopreening when nest reliefs were protracted, whereas returners that did not bring a fish started allopreening sooner than either their brooding partners or other returners that brought a fish. Common Murres in better condition (higher body mass and lower lipid metabolite levels) left the colony sooner after their returning mates fed the chick compared to Common Murres in worse condition. Birds with higher chick-feeding rates brought fish back in more visits, which suggests that these were higher-quality birds. When birds vary in their turn-taking ceremonial behaviors, they may be negotiating by providing their partners with cues about their condition. Since Common Murres have long-term pair bonds and both parents are necessary to raise offspring, mates should respond to information from their partners if they can do so without compromising their own condition beyond a critical threshold.  2017 American Ornithological Society.","MA398","PT","","",""
"Arginine vasotocin modulates associative learning in a mutualistic cleaner fish","Social environmental complexity induces structural and biochemical changes in animals' brains, which are linked to the improvement of animals' learning abilities. The nonapeptides from the arginine vasopressin (AVP) family (arginine vasotocin, AVT, in non-mammals) play a significant role in the regulation of social behavior, particularly in the formation of social memories and individual recognition. Moreover, the role of AVT in the regulation of interspecific interactions has only recently started to be addressed in the context of cleaner fish mutualisms and learning. Variance in the distribution of AVP receptor expression, which is linked to distinct neural systems (related to the dorsolateral and the dorsomedial telencephalon), is known to be implicated in differences in individual learning processes. Here we asked if the associative learning performance of the Indo-Pacific bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) is regulated by AVT. We tested the influence of AVT upon the cleaners' ability to solve two different problems (cue and place discrimination tasks) that in principle differ in ecological relevance and are associated with two different memory systems. We found that AVT affected the learning competence of cleaners differently between tasks, as individual performance showed distinct response selectivity to AVT dosage levels. However, only in the ecologically relevant task was their learning response improved by blocking AVT via treatment with the antagonist Manning compound. Our findings demonstrate that AVT pathways, which are implicated in the regulation of interspecific behavior (i.e., a cleaner's willingness to seek interactions with clients), are also linked to individual learning ability in the context of mutualistic behavior, and in tune with socio-ecological demands.","MA25","PT","","",""
"Friend or foe: Inter-specific interactions and conflicts of interest within the family","1. Interactions between species can vary from mutually beneficial to evolutionarily neutral to antagonistic, even when the same two species are involved. Similarly, social interactions between members of the same species can lie on a spectrum from conflict to cooperation. 2. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variation in the two types of social behaviour are interconnected. Is the fitness of the various classes of social partner within species (such as parent and offspring, or male and female) differently affected by interactions with a second species? Moreover, can inter-specific interactions influence the outcome of social interactions within species? 3. The present experiments focus on the interactions between the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides Herbst and the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi G. Canestrini & R. Canestrini. The approach was to measure the fitness of burying beetle mothers, fathers, and offspring after reproduction, which took place either in the presence or absence of mites. 4. We found that male, female, and larval burying beetles derive contrasting fitness costs and benefits from their interactions with the mite, despite sharing a common family environment. From the mite's perspective, its relationship with the burying beetle can, therefore, be simultaneously antagonistic, neutral, and possibly even mutualistic, depending on the particular family member involved. We also found that mites can potentially change the outcome of evolutionary conflicts within the family. 5. We conclude that inter-specific interactions can explain some of the variation in social interactions seen within species. It is further suggested that intra-specific interactions might contribute to variation in the outcome of interactions between species.  2015 The Royal Entomological Society.","MA156","PT","","",""
"Small-scale spatial variability in the distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi affects plant performance and fungal diversity","The effects of spatial heterogeneity in negative biological interactions on individual performance and species diversity have been studied extensively. However, little is known about the respective effects involving positive biological interactions, including the symbiosis between plants and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Using a greenhouse bioassay, we explored how spatial heterogeneity of natural soil inoculum influences the performance of pine seedlings and composition of their root-associated EM fungi. When the inoculum was homogenously distributed, a single EM fungal taxon dominated the roots of most pine seedlings, reducing the diversity of EM fungi at the treatment level, while substantially improving pine seedling performance. In contrast, clumped inoculum allowed the proliferation of several different EM fungi, increasing the overall EM fungal diversity. The most dominant EM fungal taxon detected in the homogeneous treatment was also a highly beneficial mutualist, implying that the trade-off between competitive ability and mutualistic capacity does not always exist.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","MA327","PT","","",""
"History and present scope of field studies on Macaca fuscata yakui at Yakushima Island, Japan","Field studies on Japanese macaques on Yakushima Island started in the mid-1970s, >25 yr after the emergence of Japanese primatology, in response to criticism of methods using provisioning and the desire to find the socioecological factors influencing the social life of macaques in natural habitats. We habituated macaques without provisioning mainly in the coastal warm-temperate forest and found that they lived in small troops with a high socionomic sex ratio. Observations of several troop fissions and troop takeovers by nontroop males suggest that Yakushima macaques have a different social organization from that of Japanese macaques in other habitats. For example, youngest ascendancy as the dominance relationhip among sisters, which usually occurs in provisioned troops, was absent in Yakushima macaques. We compared their ecological and social features with those of Japanese macaques at Kinkazan (cool-temperate forests) and found that abundance of high-quality foods may cause stronger intra- and intertroop competition at Yakushima. Female Yakushima macaques may more positively solicit nontroop males to associate with them during the mating season. Such a tendency may promote frequent male movement between troops and frequent troop fissions. Though ecological factors form social features of Japanese macaques, some features such as male association and movements between troops are not accounted for via socioecology. Recent field studies have focused on macaques living at higher altitudes in Yakushima and on individual survival strategies by taking diverse viewpoints and using new technologies. DNA analysis of fecal samples shows low genetic diversity and suggests the macaques' recent expansion from lowland to highland forests in Yakushima. The population censuses conducted annually indicate that the higher-altitude macaques have a larger home range but a similar group size versus their counterparts at low elevations. The unsolved issues in socioecology will pose a challenge to the younger generation of primatologists. Conservation of macaques and their habitat is one of our major activities at Yakushima. The level of protection has gradually increased in the National Park at Yakushima and, via our various conservation efforts, its most important area was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. However, large-scale logging in the 1960s and 1970s caused the loss of macaque habitats and led to increased crop damage by them in the 1980s. We have proposed effective methods to protect cultivated fields from macaques as well as several plans for sustainable use of forests, such as ecotourism and a fieldwork course for university students. Local residents and researchers have created several nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to promote conservation and nature study at Yakushima. The role of local NGOs is particularly important to mitigate conflicts between people and wildlife. Though hundreds of macaques are still captured as pests annually in Yakushima, we continue the conservation measures and spread awareness of conservation in cooperation with the local NGOs.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","MA179","PT","","",""
"Food Sharing Patterns in Three Species of Callitrichid Monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, Saguinus midas): Individual and Species Differences","Food sharing (FS) in cooperatively breeding callitrichids is unusual among nonhuman primates because they regularly share significant amounts of preferred food with immatures and engage in proactive FS. However, it is still unclear which classes of individuals (males or females, breeders or helpers) engage most in FS, and whether differences exist among callitrichid species. In the first part of this study, we characterized general FS patterns in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). We found substantial adult-immature FS, and female breeders shared the least with immatures. This conflicts with previously published studies, where data were collected with the prevailing standard method of providing a food bowl to the entire group. In the second part, a comparison of our access-bias-free method and the standard method suggested that previous findings are likely the result of access bias. In the third part, we investigated species differences in adult-adult FS among common marmosets, golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas), and red-handed tamarins (Saguinus midas). As common marmosets show lower levels of interdependence within groups, we expected more adult-adult FS in tamarins compared with marmosets. Adult-adult FS was indeed more prevalent in tamarins and not exclusively directed from male breeders to female breeders. Therefore, our results suggest that adult- adult FS in marmosets mostly reflects the high energetic demands of female breeders, whereas in the more interdependent tamarins, it may be used to reinforce cooperative bonds between adult group members.  2019 American Psychological Association.","MA152","PT","","",""
"Host-parasite dynamics lead to mixed cooperative games","Although the Prisoner's dilemma is a leading metaphor for the evolution of sociality, only a few studies demonstrate that this game indeed operates in nature. We offer an alternative perspective, in which parasites and their hosts are used as a model system, suggesting that Prisoner's dilemma may be rare due to different individuals experiencing variation in the payoffs they receive from alternative strategies. Ectoparasites (such as fleas) move stochastically between hosts, causing differential parasite burdens. The resulting variance in the need for cooperation - in this case cooperative allogrooming - means that payoffs for different strategies (e.g. cooperate and defect) are not fixed. Our simulations revealed that due to parasite dynamics, cooperation among hosts conforms to a mixture of two games: Mutualism and Cruel Bind, both of which are more likely to coerce individuals into mutual cooperation than Prisoner's dilemma. Though interesting, Prisoner's dilemma is in fact the least likely scenario. If payoff variation is common, the dominance of the Prisoner's dilemma paradigm may have made us unnecessarily puzzled by cooperation in nature.","MA183","PT","","",""
