"Aggressive responses to playback of solos and duets in a Neotropical antbird","Duetting behaviour is a unique form of animal communication that occurs in many diverse taxa in the animal kingdom. Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner's songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of barred antshrikes, Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects' behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding.

"Alternative reproductive tactics in male Cape ground squirrels Xerus inauris","In some animal societies, males vary in the strategies and tactics that they use for reproduction. Explanations for the evolution of alternative tactics have usually focussed on extrinsic factors such as social status, the environment or population density and have rarely examined proximate differences between individuals. Anecdotal evidence suggests that two alternative reproductive tactics occur in cooperatively breeding male Cape ground squirrels. Here we show that there is strong empirical support for physiological and behavioural differences to uphold this claim. `Dispersed' males have higher resting metabolic rates and a heightened pituitary activity, compared with philopatric `natal' males that have higher circulating cortisol levels. Dispersed males also spend more time moving and less time feeding than natal males. Additionally, lone males spend a greater proportion of their time vigilant and less of their time foraging than those that were in groups. The choice of whether to stay natal or become a disperser may depend on a number of factors such as age, natal group kin structure and reproductive suppression, and the likelihood of successful reproduction whilst remaining natal. Measuring proximate factors, such as behavioural and endocrine function, may provide valuable insights into mechanisms that underlie the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics.

"Antagonistic interactions among coral-associated bacteria","Reef-building corals are comprised of close associations between the coral animal, symbiotic zooxanthellae, and a diversity of associated microbes (including Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi). Together, these comprise the coral holobiont - a paradigm that emphasizes the potential contributions of each component to the overall function and health of the coral. Little is known about the ecology of the coral-associated microbial community and its hypothesized role in coral health. We explored bacteria-bacteria antagonism among 67 bacterial isolates from the scleractinian coral Montastrea annularis at two temperatures using Burkholder agar diffusion assays. A majority of isolates exhibited inhibitory activity (69.6% of isolates at 25C, 52.2% at 31C), with members of the -proteobacteria (Vibrionales and Alteromonadales) being especially antagonistic. Elevated temperatures generally reduced levels of antagonism, although the effects were complex. Several potential pathogens were observed in the microbial community of apparently healthy corals, and 11.6% of isolates were able to inhibit the growth of the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi at 25C. Overall, this study demonstrates that antagonism could be a structuring force in coral-associated microbial communities and may contribute to pathogenesis as well as disease resistance.  2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","MA19","","","",""
"Bartonellosis: One health perspectives for an emerging infectious disease","In recent years, an increasing number of Bartonella species have been identified as zoonotic pathogens, transmitted by animal bites, scratches, arthropods and even by needle sticks. Considering the diversity of newly discovered Bartonella species and subspecies and the large number and ecologically diverse animal reservoir hosts and the evolving spectrum of arthropod vectors that can transmit these bacteria among animals and humans, the clinical and diagnostic challenges posed by Bartonella transmission in nature are presumably much more complex than is currently appreciated by diagnosticians, vector biologists, ecologists, physicians, or veterinarians. Historically the term ""bartonellosis"" was attributed to infections with Bartonella bacilliformis, transmitted by sandflies in the Peruvian Andes. Currently, however, bartonellosis now includes infections caused by any Bartonella sp. anywhere in the world. Potentially, because Bartonella spp. can infect erythrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, CD34+ progenitor cells, and various macrophage-type cells, including microglial cells, dendritic cells, and circulating monocytes in vitro, the clinical and pathological manifestations of bartonellosis appear to be very diverse in both sick animals and human patients. Because 75% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, many of which are vector-transmitted by an arthropod, a One Health approach to bartonellosis and other zoonotic infections is needed to properly address animal health, public health, and environmental factors that influence the distribution and transmission of these bacteria. The One Health concept encourages a spirit of cooperation among animal, environmental, and human health professionals and promotes developing integrated solutions for complex problems that impact the health of animals, humans, and the planet. Importantly, substantial research is needed to define the medical importance of this genus as a cause of animal and human illnesses.  The Author 2014.

"Behavioural type, status and social context affect behaviour and resource allocation in cooperatively breeding cichlids","Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates) according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social contexts, especially in highly social species.

"Between-group competition, intra-group cooperation and relative performance","We report the results of a new public goods experiment with an intra-group cooperation dilemma and inter-group competition. In our design subjects receive information about their relative individual and group performance after each round with non-incentivized and then incentivized group competition. We found that, on average, individuals with low relative performance reduce their contributions to the public good, but groups with low performance increase theirs. With incentivized competition, where the relative ranking of the group increases individual payoffs, the reaction to relative performance is larger with individuals contributing more to the group; further, we observe that the variance of strategies decreases as individual and group rankings increase. These results offer new insights on how social comparison shapes similar reactions in games with different incentives for group performance and how competition and cooperation can influence each other.","MA35","","","",""
"Capuchin monkeys (Sapajus {[}Cebus] apella) play Nash equilibria in dynamic games, but their decisions are likely not influenced by oxytocin","Comparative approaches to experimental economics have shed light on the evolution of social decision-making across a range of primate species, including humans. Here we replicate our previous work looking at six pairs of capuchin monkeys' (Sapajus {[}Cebus] apella) responses to scenarios requiring both coordination (Assurance Game) and anti-coordination (Hawk-Dove Game). This then provides a foundation for assessing their responses to two additional games, one with a scenario of beneficial cooperation with a temptation to defect (Prisoner's Dilemma) and one with an environment requiring changing strategies within short temporal proximity (Alternating Economic Game). We additionally explored the effects of exogenous oxytocin on decision-making. Oxytocin did not affect decisions in any of our games. Results from the first two games largely replicated our previous findings. Responses to the Prisoner's Dilemma were more varied than was seen in previous games, with pairs respectively cooperating, defecting, and failing to establish stable strategies. Such variability indicates that this game may be a good assay for individual differences in social decision-making. Finally, capuchins were able to flexibly switch between their previously established strategies within each of the different games, even when the games were presented within the same session, requiring strategy adjustments within short temporal proximity. These results build on earlier findings showing that capuchins can alter decision-making strategies as the context demands, which is likely essential for decision-making in naturally occurring contexts.","MA39","","","",""
"Chytrid epidemics may increase genetic diversity of a diatom spring-bloom","Contrary to expectation, populations of clonal organisms are often genetically highly diverse. In phytoplankton, this diversity is maintained throughout periods of high population growth (that is, blooms), even though competitive exclusion among genotypes should hypothetically lead to the dominance of a few superior genotypes. Genotype-specific parasitism may be one mechanism that helps maintain such high-genotypic diversity of clonal organisms. Here, we present a comparison of population genetic similarity by estimating the beta-dispersion among genotypes of early and peak bloom populations of the diatom Asterionella formosa for three spring-blooms under high or low parasite pressure. The Asterionella population showed greater beta-dispersion at peak bloom than early bloom in the 2 years with high parasite pressure, whereas the within group dispersion did not change under low parasite pressure. Our findings support that high prevalence parasitism can promote genetic diversification of natural populations of clonal hosts.  2013 International Society for Microbial Ecology.","MA46","","","",""
"Climate Change and Phenological Mismatch in Trophic Interactions Among Plants, Insects, and Vertebrates","Phenological mismatch results when interacting species change the timing of regularly repeated phases in their life cycles at different rates. We review whether this continuously ongoing phenomenon, also known as trophic asynchrony, is becoming morecommonunder ongoing rapid climate change. In antagonistic trophic interactions, any mismatch will have negative impacts for only one of the species, whereas in mutualistic interactions, both partners are expected to suffer. Trophic mismatch is therefore expected to last for evolutionarily short periods, perhaps only a few seasons, adding to the difficulty of attributing it to climate change, which requires long-term data. So far, the prediction that diverging phenologies linked to climate change will cause mismatch is most clearly met in antagonistic interactions at high latitudes in the Artic. There is limited evidence of phenological mismatch in mutualistic interactions, possibly because of strong selection on mutualists to have co-adapted phenological strategies. The study of individual plasticity, population variation, and the genetic bases for phenological strategies is in its infancy. Recent work on woody plants revealed the large imprint of historic climate change on temperature, chilling, and day-length thresholds used by different species to synchronize their phenophases, which in the Northern Hemisphere has led to biogeographic phenological regions inwhich long-lived plants have adapted to particular interannual and intermillennial amplitudes of climate change.","MA47","","","",""
"Coloration reflects behavioural types in the convict cichlid, Amatitlania siquia","Interindividual behavioural differences, consistent over time and across situations, are frequently related to differences in reproductive success, susceptibility to disease and competitive ability. The behavioural phenotype of a conspecific is likely to affect the outcome of a social interaction, so an individual must be able to accurately assess behavioural phenotypes in order to optimize behavioural responses during mate choice, cooperative relationships and agonistic interactions. However, behavioural assessment based on dyadic interactions in different contexts can be costly because it may require significant time, increase the risk of predation and often necessitates special cognitive abilities. Different colour cues are associated with different life history strategies in many species, so coloration might also correlate with behavioural phenotype. Thus, conspecifics could use coloration as a single cue for the mediation of social interactions. We investigated the relationship between personality and coloration in the monogamous, biparental convict cichlid. This species has black melanin-based stripes with interindividual variation in the intensity of these stripes. In addition, females have bright orange spots on their abdomens. Using repeatable measures of boldness, exploration and aggressiveness, we were able to define a behavioural syndrome and quantified the behavioural type of each individual. Behavioural types were predicted by colour traits. In particular, proactive individuals (more aggressive, bolder and quicker to resume behaviour after being startled) were more likely to be dark and, among females, have smaller orange areas. Our results support the hypothesis that coloration in the convict cichlid is related to personality. Thus, coloration could play an important role in mediating social interactions, allowing a quick and reliable assessment of conspecifics' behavioural types.

"Comparing environmental impacts for livestock products: A review of life cycle assessments","Livestock production has a major impact on the environment. Choosing a more environmentally-friendly livestock product in a diet can mitigate environmental impact. The objective of this research was to compare assessments of the environmental impact of livestock products. Twenty-five peer-reviewed studies were found that assessed the impact of production of pork, chicken, beef, milk, and eggs using life cycle analysis (LCA). Only 16 of these studies were reviewed, based on five criteria: study from an OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) country, non-organic production, type of LCA methodology, allocation method used, and definition of system boundary. LCA results of these 16 studies were expressed in three ways: per kg product, per kg protein, and per kg of average daily intake of each product for an OECD country. The review yielded a consistent ranging of results for use of land and energy, and for climate change. No clear pattern was found, however, for eutrophication and acidification. Production of 1 kg of beef used most land and energy, and had highest global warming potential (GWP), followed by production of 1 kg of pork, chicken, eggs, and milk. Differences in environmental impact among pork, chicken, and beef can be explained mainly by 3 factors: differences in feed efficiency, differences in enteric CH4 emission between monogastric animals and ruminants, and differences in reproduction rates. The impact of production of 1 kg of meat (pork, chicken, beef) was high compared with production of 1 kg of milk and eggs because of the relatively high water content of milk and eggs. Production of 1 kg of beef protein also had the highest impact, followed by pork protein, whereas chicken protein had the lowest impact. This result also explained why consumption of beef was responsible for the largest part of the land use and GWP in an average OECD diet. This review did not show consistent differences in environmental impact per kg protein in milk, pork, chicken and eggs. Only one study compared environmental impact of meat versus milk and eggs. Conclusions regarding impact of pork or chicken versus impact of milk or eggs require additional comparative studies and further harmonization of LCA methodology. Interpretation of current LCA results for livestock products, moreover, is hindered because results do not include environmental consequences of competition for land between humans and animals, and consequences of land-use changes. We recommend, therefore, to include these consequences in future LCAs of livestock products.  2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","MA59","","","",""
"Competitive altruism: from reciprocity to the handicap principle","Current work on cooperation is focused on the theory of reciprocal altruism. However, reciprocity is just one way of getting a return on an investment in altruism and is difficult to apply to many examples. Reciprocity theory addresses how animals respond dynamically to others so as to cooperate without being exploited. I discuss how introducing differences in individual generosity together with partner choice into models of reciprocity can lead to an escalation in altruistic behaviour. Individuals may compete for the most altruistic partners and non-altruists may become ostracized. I refer to this phenomenon as competitive altruism and propose that it can represent a move away from the dynamic responsiveness of reciprocity. Altruism may be rewarded in kind, but rewards may be indirectly accrued or may not involve the return of altruism at all, for example if altruists tend to be chosen as mates. This variety makes the idea of competitive altruism relevant to behaviours which cannot be explained by reciprocity. I consider whether altruism might act as a signal of quality, as proposed by the handicap principle. I suggest that altruistic acts could make particularly effective signals because of the inherent benefits to receivers. I consider how reciprocity and competitive altruism are related and how they may be distinguished.","MA63","","","",""
"Complement of integrated fertilizer management and integrated pest management concepts to ameliorate faba bean growth and yield [Ergnzung des integrierten dngungs und krankheitsmanagements zur verbesserung des wachstums und ertrags von ackerbohnen]","Twenty-one microbial preparations recommended for controlling pathogenic fungal strains causing root rot and wilt diseases of faba bean were investigated for antibiosis against several symbiotic and associative diazotrophs adopting a modified agar-plate-inhibition-zone assay. Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium exhibited a somewhat similar susceptibility to biocontrol agents while associative diazotrophs showed variable responses. Azotobacter, compared to others, was severely inhibited by such bio-candidates. The members of the biofertilizer formulation Biofertan did bear mixed cultivation with the majority of biocontrol agents. Among those, Bacillus subtilis was deemed the pioneer. In pot experiments, almost all the antagonists significantly restricted the severity of root rot and wilt diseases besides modifying faba bean seedling stand and improving plant development. This was very obvious with shoot biomass increases of >50%. Moreover, the bioagents successfully recovered the legume establishment, seriously injured due to pathogenic fungal infection. Simultaneous inoculation with Rhizobium and biocontrol agents provided more growth stimulation compared to either when introduced individually. Field-grown faba beans were inoculated with the diazotroph and representatives of biocontrol strains by two different methods, seed coating and over-head soil. Growth parameters determined were the highest when the legume plant was seed-coated by Rhizobium simultaneously over-head soil inoculated with the bacterial bioagents; this was reported with Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aerugenosa. The significance of combined application of biofertilizer and bioagent to ensure cheap, clean and safe farm products is discussed.  2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","MA65","","","",""
"Complex network representation of multiagent systems with cooperative and competitive interactions","The dynamic behavior of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is analyzed in the context of a modifed Lotka-Volterra model. The interaction strength is determined by the difference of agent sizes: as the difference increases, the interaction is weaker. Competitive and cooperative scenarios are analyzed, showing clusters of agents in the stationary state. However, meantime in the competitive scenario the agent sizes are constrained to be non greater than the capacity value ( = 1), in the cooperative scenario, they are allowed to exceed such capacity making clear the advantages of cooperation. The complex network representation is introduced in order to enhance the role of agent sizes and their one-on-one interactions in the dynamic behavior of the system.  2014 by the Author.","MA67","","","",""
"Conservation of protists: Is it needed at all?","Protists have scarcely been considered in traditional perspectives and strategies in environmental management and biodiversity conservation. This is a remarkable omission given that these tiny organisms are highly diverse, and have performed as key ecological players in evolutionary theatres for over a billion years of Earth history. Protists hold key roles in nearly all ecosystems, notably as participants in fluxes of energy and matter through foodwebs that centre on their predation on microbes. In spite of this, they have been largely ignored in conservation issues due to a widespread, naive belief that protists are ubiquitous and cosmopolitanously distributed. Nevertheless, recent research shows that many protists have markedly restricted distributions. These range from palaeoendemics (Gondwanan-Laurasian distribution) to local endemics. Our ignorance about the ultimate and proximate causes of such acute disparities in scale-dependent distributions of protists can be flagged as a singular reason to preserve these more cryptic participants in ecological and evolutionary dynamics. This argument is disturbing when one considers anthropogenic modifications of landscapes and the very poorly understood roles of protists in ecological processes in soils, not least in agroecolandscapes and hydrological systems. Major concerns include host specific symbiotic, symphoric and parasitic species which become extinct, unseen and largely unknown, alongside their metazoan hosts; change or loss of habitats; massive change or loss of type localities; and losses of unique genetic resources and evolutionary potential. These concerns are illustrated by examples to argue that conservation of protists should be integral to any strategy that traditionally targets vascular plants and animals. The ongoing decline in research capacity to inventory and classify protist diversity exemplifies a most acute symptom of the failures, at local, national and international levels, to support scientific responses to the biodiversity crisis. Responsible responses to these severe problems need to centre on the revival of natural history as the core discipline in biology.  2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","MA72","","","",""
"Context-dependent interactions of insects and defensive symbionts: insights from a novel system in siricid woodwasps","Many insect species derive fitness benefits from associations with defensive microbial symbionts that confer protection against pathogens and parasites. These relationships are varied and diverse, but a number of studies highlight important trends. The effects of defensive symbionts can be context-dependent and influenced by variable selection imposed by the organism against which the symbiont protects. Additionally, genetic variation in both hosts and symbionts can greatly influence the outcome of these interactions. Here, we describe interactions between siricid woodwasps, their fungal symbionts and parasitic nematodes and show how defense by symbionts in this system is also context-dependent. The species or strain of the white rot fungus used as a symbiont by Sirex can influence parasitism of these hosts by Deladenus nematodes.  2019","MA73","","","",""
"Cooperation and conflict in the evolution of multicellularity","Multicellular organisms probably originated as groups of cells formed in several ways, including cell proliferation from a group of founder cells and aggregation. Cooperation among cells benefits the group, but may be costly (altruistic) or beneficial (synergistic) to individual cooperating cells. In this paper, we study conflict mediation, the process by which genetic modifiers evolve that enhance cooperation by altering the parameters of development or rules of formation of cell groups. We are particularly interested in the conditions under which these modifiers lead to a new higher-level unit of selection with increased cooperation among group members and heritable variation in fitness at the group level. By sculpting the fitness variation and opportunity for selection at the two levels, conflict modifiers create new functions at the organism level. An organism is more than a group of cooperating cells related by common descent; organisms require adaptations that regulate conflict within. Otherwise their continued evolution is frustrated by the: creation of within-organism variation and conflict between levels of selection. The evolution of conflict modifiers is a necessary prerequisite to the emergence of individuality and the continued well being of the organism. Conflict leads - through the evolution of adaptations that reduce it - to greater individuality and harmony for the organism.","MA78","","","",""
"Cooperation in humans: competition between groups and proximate emotions","Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms that favour cooperation remains one of the greatest challenges in the biological and social sciences. A number of theoretical studies have suggested that competition between groups may have played a key role in the evolution of cooperation within human societies, and similar ideas have been discussed for other organisms, especially cooperative breeding vertebrates. However, there is a relative lack of empirical work testing these ideas. Our experiment found, in public goods games with humans, that when groups competed with other groups for financial rewards, individuals made larger contributions within their own groups. In such situations, participants were more likely to regard their group mates as collaborators rather than competitors. Variation in contribution among individuals, either with or without intergroup competition, was positively correlated with individuals' propensity to regard group mates as collaborators. We found that the levels of both guilt and anger individuals experienced were a function of their own contributions and those of their group mates. Overall, our results arc consistent with the idea that the level of cooperation can be influenced by proximate emotions, which vary with the degree of intergroup competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"Cooperation promotes the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites with unitary growth","Most animals have specialized into separate sexes but most plants remain hermaphroditic. The underlining cause for this is still unclear. Here we address this question by evolutionary stable strategy analysis and exact calculation of frequency-dependent selection and genetic drift in geographically structured populations. Reproductive investments of hermaphrodites are divided into male and female functions, and each sex requires linear investments that increase linearly with successful gamete number and reusable investments (RIs) that increase less than linearly. Individuals specializing into one sex require RIs of only this sex and thus can produce more gametes. However, these gametes suffer strong kin competition as they are of the same sex and gamete number of the other sex decreases. The success of individuals specializing into one sex requires individuals specializing into the other sex to cooperate with them, providing them with more opposite-sex gametes and relaxing them of the same-sex competition. The evolution of this cooperation does not require two rare mutations to happen simultaneously at the same place, because single-sex mutants can sparsely spread in a hermaphroditic population with RIs despite genetic drift and wait for mutants of the other sex to arise. RI resembles fixed cost in previous theories. However, previous theories considered all costs except for costs for gametes as fixed costs and this does not capture an important plant-animal difference; modular growth of sexual organs in most plants and some animals promotes reproductive investments to increase linearly with offspring number, so their investments in sexual organs are linear investments rather than fixed costs. This study shows the evolution of separate sexes from hermaphrodites as an example of the evolution of cooperation and mutualism as in harmony games, and highlights modular growth as an important factor that prevents most plants and some animals from evolving into separate sexes.

"Crossing scales, crossing disciplines: Collective motion and collective action in the Global Commons","Two conflicting tendencies can be seen throughout the biological world: individuality and collective behaviour. Natural selection operates on differences among individuals, rewarding those who perform better. Nonetheless, even within this milieu, cooperation arises, and the repeated emergence of multicellularity is the most striking example. The same tendencies are played out at higher levels, as individuals cooperate in groups, which compete with other such groups. Many of our environmental and other global problems can be traced to such conflicts, and to the unwillingness of individual agents to take account of the greater good. One of the great challenges in achieving sustainability will be in understanding the basis of cooperation, and in taking multicellularity to yet a higher level, finding the pathways to the level of cooperation that is the only hope for the preservation of the planet.  2010 The Royal Society.","MA83","","","",""
"Decomposer diversity and identity influence plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning","Plant productivity and other ecosystem functions often increase with plant diversity at a local scale. Alongside various plant-centered explanations for this pattern, there is accumulating evidence that multi-trophic interactions shape this relationship. Here, we investigated for the first time if plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are mediated or driven by decomposer animal diversity and identity using a double-diversity microcosm experiment. We show that many ecosystem processes and ecosystem multifunctionality (herbaceous shoot biomass production, litter removal, and N uptake) were affected by both plant and decomposer diversity, with ecosystem process rates often being maximal at intermediate to high plant and decomposer diversity and minimal at both low plant and decomposer diversity. Decomposers relaxed interspecific plant competition by enlarging chemical (increased N uptake and surface-litter decomposition) and spatial (increasing deep-root biomass) habitat space and by promoting plant complementarity. Anecic earthworms and isopods functioned as key decomposers; although decomposer diversity effects did not solely rely on these two decomposer species, positive plant net biodiversity and complementarity effects only occurred in the absence of isopods and the presence of anecic earthworms. Using a structural equation model, we explained 76\% of the variance in plant complementarity, identified direct and indirect effect paths, and showed that the presence of key decomposers accounted for approximately three-quarters of the explained variance. We conclude that decomposer animals have been underappreciated as contributing agents of plant diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Elevated decomposer performance at high plant diversity found in previous experiments likely positively feeds back to plant performance, thus contributing to the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.","MA87","","","",""
"Determinants of reproductive success in dominant female meerkats","1. In cooperative societies with high reproductive skew, selection on females is likely to operate principally through variation in the probability of acquiring dominant status and variation in reproductive success while dominant. Despite this, few studies of cooperative societies have investigated the factors that influence which females become dominant, and/or their reproductive output while in the dominant position. 2. Here we use long-term data from a wild meerkat population to describe variation in the breeding success of dominant female meerkats Suricata suricatta and investigate its causes. 3. Female meerkats compete intensely for breeding positions, and the probability of acquiring the breeding role depends upon a female's age in relation to competitors and her weight, both at the time of dominance acquisition and early in life. 4. Once dominant, individual differences in breeding success depend principally on the duration of dominance tenure. Females remain for longer in the dominant position if they are heavier than their competitors at the start of dominance, and if the number of adult female competitors at the start is low. 5. Female breeding success is also affected by variation in fecundity and pup survival, both of which increase with group size. After controlling for these effects, female body weight has a positive influence on breeding rate and litter size, while the number of adult female competitors reduces litter survival. 6. These findings suggest that selection for body weight and competitive ability will be high in female meerkats, which may moderate their investment in cooperative activities. We suggest that similar consequences of competition may occur among females in other cooperative societies where the benefits of attaining dominance status are high.  2007 The Authors.","MA88","","","",""
"Determinants of sperm transfer in the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata: male variation, female condition and copulation duration","Recent studies suggest that sperm production and transfer may have significant costs to males. Male sperm investment into a current copulation may therefore influence resources available for future matings, which selects for male strategic mating investment. In addition, females may also benefit from actively or passively altering the number of sperm transferred by males. In the scorpionfly Panorpa cognata, the number of sperm transferred during copulation depended on copulation duration and males in good condition (residual weight) copulated longer and also transferred more sperm. Moreover, sperm transferred and stored per unit time was higher in copulations with females in good condition than in copulations with females in poor condition. Males varied greatly and consistently in their sperm transfer rate, indicative of costs associated with this trait. The duration of the pairing prelude also varied between males and correlated negatively with the male's sperm transfer rate, but no other male character correlated significantly with male sperm transfer rate. The results are consistent with strategic mating effort but sperm transfer could also be facilitated by the physical size of females and/or females in good condition may be more cooperative during sperm transfer.","MA89","","","",""
"Developmental plasticity and social specialization in cooperative societies","Cooperative breeding systems showcase the diversity of social trajectories within and among species, ranging from the extremes of eusocial insects where individuals become irreversibly specialized as fecund queens or sterile workers, to vertebrate systems where individuals maintain the flexibility to breed throughout life. Between these extremes lies a continuum with individuals exhibiting varying degrees of specialization in their behaviour. Most research on cooperative breeders, particularly on vertebrate systems, has focused on why helping has evolved, rather than addressing this diversity. Here, we present a framework to explain variation in the timing, extent and flexibility of phenotypic divergence across vertebrate and invertebrate cooperative systems. We base our framework on recent theory about how individuals integrate information about the environment from different sources (genes, parents and direct experiences) when establishing their developmental trajectory. We discuss how the timing and degree of divergence and specialization are influenced by the availability and reliability of information about later fitness options and by the extent to which individuals have control over their development. Throughout, we use this developmental perspective to draw broad comparisons across vertebrate and invertebrate systems, which are often considered separately.

"Diversity and evolutionary patterns of bacterial gut associates of corbiculate bees","The animal gut is a habitat for diverse communities of microorganisms (microbiota). Honeybees and bumblebees have recently been shown to harbour a distinct and species poor microbiota, which may confer protection against parasites. Here, we investigate diversity, host specificity and transmission mode of two of the most common, yet poorly known, gut bacteria of honeybees and bumblebees: Snodgrassella alvi (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella apicola (Gammaproteobacteria). We analysed 16S rRNA gene sequences of these bacteria from diverse bee host species across most of the honeybee and bumblebee phylogenetic diversity from North America, Europe and Asia. These focal bacteria were present in 92% of bumblebee species and all honeybee species but were found to be absent in the two related corbiculate bee tribes, the stingless bees (Meliponini) and orchid bees (Euglossini). Both Snodgrassella alvi and Gilliamella apicola phylogenies show significant topological congruence with the phylogeny of their bee hosts, albeit with a considerable degree of putative host switches. Furthermore, we found that phylogenetic distances between Gilliamella apicola samples correlated with the geographical distance between sampling locations. This tentatively suggests that the environmental transmission rate, as set by geographical distance, affects the distribution of G. apicola infections. We show experimentally that both bacterial taxa can be vertically transmitted from the mother colony to daughter queens, and social contact with nest mates after emergence from the pupa greatly facilitates this transmission. Therefore, sociality may play an important role in vertical transmission and opens up the potential for co-evolution or at least a close association of gut bacteria with their hosts.  2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","MA95","","","",""
"Ectosymbiosis is a critical factor in. the local benthic biodiversity of the Antarctic deep sea","In deep-sea benthic environments, competition for hard substrates is a critical factor in the distribution and diversity of organisms. In this context, the occurrence of biotic substrates in addition to mineral substrates may change the characteristics of sessile fauna. We tested this hypothesis at different localities of the Weddell Sea (Antarctica) by Studying the diversity of ectosymbionts living on the spines of cidaroids (echinoids), The presence of cidaroids promoted a higher total specific richness and increased sessile species abundance, but did riot change the diversity. Analyses of species distribution suggested that the cidaroids are a favourable habitat for sessile organisms, compared to rocks, but are colonized by relatively specialist sessile Species, leaving the unfavourable rock habitat to more generalist species. Therefore, our study highlights the role of some living organisms, such as cidaroids, as key species increasing Antarctic benthic deep-sea species richness through the niche they provide to symbiotic species.","MA112","","","",""
"Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning: A consensus of current knowledge","Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.","MA113","","","",""

The variation could not be attributed to a more or less scattered nematode invasion over time since it was also recorded after simultaneous injection of a fixed DJ dose. The proportion of encapsulated nematodes declined with increasing dose (injected DJs/larva) from approx 80% for 1 DJ/larva to 33-34% for 20 DJ/larva.Tipula oleracealarvae were capable of encapsulating nematodes with and without symbionts inside the hemocoel; however, at doses of 10 and 20 DJ/larva, axenic nematodes were encapsulated less frequently than monoxenic nematodes. Injected axenic nematodes that were not encapsulated did not develop inT. oleracealarvae but disappeared from the insect's hemocoel.

"Evidence for personality conformity, not social niche specialization in social jays","Animal personality traits are defined as consistent individual differences in behavior over time and across contexts. Occasionally this inflexibility results in maladaptive behavioral responses to external stimuli. However, in social groups inflexible behavioral phenotypes might be favored as this could lead to more predictable social interactions. Two hypotheses seek to describe the optimal distribution of personality types within groups. The social niche specialization hypothesis states that individuals within groups should partition social roles, like personality types, to avoid conflict; whereas the conformity hypothesis states that individuals should assort with conspecifics of similar personality. However, no research so far has compared these hypotheses using data from wild animal systems. We tested boldness in the wild on 2 species with different social systems, the Mexican Jay and California Scrub-Jay. We found support for the conformity hypothesis over the social niche specialization hypothesis because individuals within groups of the social species had more similar personalities, and consequently there was a statistically significant group effect. The most likely mechanism for this conformity is social learning of behaviors through development, but more explicit research on this is needed.","MA122","","","",""
"Favouritism or intrabrood competition? Access to food and the benefits of philopatry for red-cockaded woodpeckers","In species showing delayed natal dispersal, broodmates vary in natal dispersal timing and strategy, where some choose to disperse early while others delay. In the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, typically only one juvenile male per brood delays dispersal despite the lifetime fitness benefits associated with delayed dispersal. We sought to determine whether adult favouritism or intrabrood competition over the distribution of natal food resources provides a mechanism for the persistence of individual variation in natal dispersal strategies. We show that fledgling red-cockaded woodpeckers form male-biased, linear dominance hierarchies as a result of frequent aggressive conflicts. For males, high nestling condition relative to male broodmates was a strong predictor of future dominance, and this condition-rank relationship persisted after individuals reached nutritional independence. Adults were never observed interfering with broodmate conflicts, and were only rarely aggressive towards fledglings. Adults showed no overt favouritism towards offspring when targeting individual fledglings during provisioning early in the postfledging period. However, conflict rates increased with decreasing targeted-feeding rates, suggesting that access to resources is an important function of dominance hierarchies. After fledglings were developmentally able to compete for positions near foraging adults, first-and second-ranking males were fed more often than subordinate females. Of the juvenile males surviving to spring, subordinates were more likely to disperse during their first year than were their dominant broodmates. Together, our findings suggest that for young red-cockaded woodpeckers, intrabrood social rank provides a mechanism for prioritized access to natal resources and variation in natal dispersal strategy.

"Feedback between Population and Evolutionary Dynamics Determines the Fate of Social Microbial Populations","The evolutionary spread of cheater strategies can destabilize populations engaging in social cooperative behaviors, thus demonstrating that evolutionary changes can have profound implications for population dynamics. At the same time, the relative fitness of cooperative traits often depends upon population density, thus leading to the potential for bi-directional coupling between population density and the evolution of a cooperative trait. Despite the potential importance of these eco-evolutionary feedback loops in social species, they have not yet been demonstrated experimentally and their ecological implications are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the presence of a strong feedback loop between population dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of a social microbial gene, SUC2, in laboratory yeast populations whose cooperative growth is mediated by the SUC2 gene. We directly visualize eco-evolutionary trajectories of hundreds of populations over 50-100 generations, allowing us to characterize the phase space describing the interplay of evolution and ecology in this system. Small populations collapse despite continual evolution towards increased cooperative allele frequencies; large populations with a sufficient number of cooperators ``spiral{''} to a stable state of coexistence between cooperator and cheater strategies. The presence of cheaters does not significantly affect the equilibrium population density, but it does reduce the resilience of the population as well as its ability to adapt to a rapidly deteriorating environment. Our results demonstrate the potential ecological importance of coupling between evolutionary dynamics and the population dynamics of cooperatively growing organisms, particularly in microbes. Our study suggests that this interaction may need to be considered in order to explain intraspecific variability in cooperative behaviors, and also that this feedback between evolution and ecology can critically affect the demographic fate of those species that rely on cooperation for their survival.","MA144","","","",""
"Female home range size is regulated by resource distribution and intraspecific competition: a long-term field study","The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring.

"Fitness costs of phoretic nematodes in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides","Nicrophorusvespilloides is a social beetle that rears its offspring on decomposing carrion. Wild beetles are frequently associated with two types of macrobial symbionts, mites, and nematodes. Although these organisms are believed to be phoretic commensals that harmlessly use beetles as a means of transfer between carcasses, the role of these symbionts on N.vespilloides fitness is poorly understood. Here, we show that nematodes have significant negative effects on beetle fitness across a range of worm densities and also quantify the density-dependent transmission of worms between mating individuals and from parents to offspring. Using field-caught beetles, we provide the first report of a new nematode symbiont in N.vespilloides, most closely related to Rhabditoides regina, and show that worm densities are highly variable across individuals isolated from nature but do not differ between males and females. Next, by inoculating mating females with increasing densities of nematodes, we show that worm infections significantly reduce brood size, larval survival, and larval mass, and also eliminate the trade-off between brood size and larval mass. Finally, we show that nematodes are efficiently transmitted between mating individuals and from mothers to larvae, directly and indirectly via the carcass, and that worms persist through pupation. These results show that the phoretic nematode R.regina can be highly parasitic to burying beetles but can nevertheless persist because of efficient mechanisms of intersexual and intergenerational transmission. Phoretic species are exceptionally common and may cause significant harm to their hosts, even though they rely on these larger species for transmission to new resources. However, this harm may be inevitable and unavoidable if transmission of phoretic symbionts requires nematode proliferation. It will be important to determine the generality of our results for other phoretic associates of animals. It will equally be important to assess the fitness effects of phoretic species under changing resource conditions and in the field where diverse interspecific interactions may exacerbate or reduce the negative effects of phoresy.  2018 The Authors.

"Foraging strategy predicts foraging economy in a facultative secondary nectar robber","In mutualistic interactions, the decision whether to cooperate or cheat depends on the relative costs and benefits of each strategy. In pollination mutualisms, secondary nectar robbing is a facultative behavior employed by a diverse array of nectar-feeding organisms, and is thought to be a form of cheating. Primary robbers create holes in floral tissue through which they feed on nectar, whereas secondary robbers, which often lack chewing mouthparts, feed on nectar through existing holes. Because primary robbers make nectar more readily available to secondary robbers, primary robbers facilitate the behaviors of secondary robbers. However, the net effect of facilitation on secondary robber fitness has not been empirically tested: it is unknown whether the benefit secondary robbers receive is strong enough to overcome the cost of competing with primary robbers for a shared resource. We conducted foraging experiments using the bumble bee Bombus bifarius, which can alternatively forage legitimately' (from the floral opening) or secondary-rob. We measured the relative foraging efficiencies (handling time per flower, flowers visited per minute, proportion of foraging bout spent consuming nectar) of these alternative behaviors, and tested whether the frequency of primary robbing and nectar standing crop in primary-robbed flowers of Linaria vulgaris (Plantaginaceae) affected foraging efficiency. Surprisingly, there was no effect of primary robbing frequency on the foraging efficiency of secondary-robbing B. bifarius. Instead, foraging strategy was a major predictor of foraging efficiency, with legitimate foraging being significantly more efficient than secondary robbing. Legitimate foraging was the more common strategy used by B. bifarius in our study; however, it is rarely used by B. bifarius foraging on L. vulgaris in nature, despite indications that it is more efficient. Our results suggest the need for deeper investigations into why bees adopt secondary robbing as a foraging strategy, specifically, the environmental contexts that promote the behavior.","MA153","","","",""
"Gender- and sequence-dependent predation within group colonizers of defended plants: a constraint on cheating among bark beetles?","Bark beetles engage in one of the most pronounced examples of group procurement of defended plants. Their aggregation pheromones attract both sexes and are essential to overcome constitutive and rapidly inducible lethal defenses. The relative benefits to senders versus receivers of these signals are only partly understood. Because the initial stage of host entry can be hazardous, there may be benefit to a cheating strategy, whose practitioners respond to pheromones but do not engage in host searching. Several disadvantages to cheating have been proposed, but the role of predators has not been considered. Predators exploit bark beetle pheromones to locate prey, accumulate at the breeding site, and consume adult bark beetles before they enter the tree. Preliminary experiments quantified arrival patterns in the field. We used a laboratory assay to investigate relative predation on pioneers (those that initially select and enter hosts) and responders (those that arrive at a host in response to pheromones) during host colonization. Our model system utilized the pine engraver, Ips pini, which exhibits male harem polygamy. We allowed male I. pini to colonize host tissue and added females 1 day later. Also 1 day later, we variably added additional males and predacious checkered beetles, Thanasimus dubius. These treatments included two densities of males and three densities of predators that were selected to emulate field conditions. Responding males experienced higher predation than pioneers. T. dubius ate more males than females, independent of the presence or absence of responding males. T. dubius affected the distribution of females per male, although the number of females that survived to construct ovipositional galleries was constant. We discuss the viability of cheating, implications for biological control, and predator-prey coevolution in this cooperative, group-colonizing herbivore.","MA162","","","",""
"Genetic clusters and sex-biased gene flow in a unicolonial Formica ant","Background: Animal societies are diverse, ranging from small family-based groups to extraordinarily large social networks in which many unrelated individuals interact. At the extreme of this continuum, some ant species form unicolonial populations in which workers and queens can move among multiple interconnected nests without eliciting aggression. Although unicoloniality has been mostly studied in invasive ants, it also occurs in some native non-invasive species. Unicoloniality is commonly associated with very high queen number, which may result in levels of relatedness among nestmates being so low as to raise the question of the maintenance of altruism by kin selection in such systems. However, the actual relatedness among cooperating individuals critically depends on effective dispersal and the ensuing pattern of genetic structuring. In order to better understand the evolution of unicoloniality in native non-invasive ants, we investigated the fine-scale population genetic structure and gene flow in three unicolonial populations of the wood ant F. paralugubris. Results: The analysis of geo-referenced microsatellite genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes revealed the presence of cryptic clusters of genetically-differentiated nests in the three populations of F. paralugubris. Because of this spatial genetic heterogeneity, members of the same clusters were moderately but significantly related. The comparison of nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial differentiation indicated that effective gene flow was male-biased in all populations. Conclusion: The three unicolonial populations exhibited male-biased and mostly local gene flow. The high number of queens per nest, exchanges among neighbouring nests and restricted long-distance gene flow resulted in large clusters of genetically similar nests. The positive relatedness among clustermates suggests that kin selection may still contribute to the maintenance of altruism in unicolonial populations if competition occurs among clusters.","MA164","","","",""
"Global associations between birds and vane-dwelling feather mites","Understanding host-symbiont networks is a major question in evolutionary ecology. Birds host a great diversity of endo- and ectosymbiotic organisms, with feather mites (Arachnida: Acariformes: Analgoidea, Pterolichoidea) being among the most diverse of avian symbionts. A global approach to the ecology and evolution of bird-feather-mite associations has been hampered because of the absence of a centralized data repository. Here we present the most extensive data set of associations between feather mites and birds. Data include 12 036 records of 1887 feather mite species located on the flight feathers of 2234 bird species from 147 countries. Feather mites typically located inside quills, on the skin, or on downy body feathers are not included. Data were extracted from 493 published sources dating from 1882 to 2015. Data exploration shows that although most continents and bird families are represented, most bird species remain unexplored for feather mites. Nevertheless, this is the most comprehensive data set available for enabling global macroecological analyses of feather mites and their hosts, such as ecological network analyses.

All animals are colonized by micro-organisms, most of which are benign or beneficial. Where do these micro-organisms come from? Theory predicts that micro-organisms which are transmitted vertically from parent to offspring are especially likely to be beneficial to the host, while horizontally acquired micro-organisms are opportunistic and more variable in their impact on host performance. In this issue, Mushegian etal. () investigate the source of bacteria that are required for the growth and development of Daphnia water fleas to reproductive adults. They find that, although vertically transmitted bacteria can occur in the capsule enclosing the Daphnia eggs, the micro-organisms that promote Daphnia performance are associated with the external surface of the capsule and are of likely environmental origin. This mode of transmission may be adaptive for Daphnia because, linked to the longevity and capacity for long-distance dispersal of these eggs, the environmental circumstances encountered by parent and offspring may be different; with the implication, the parental micro-organisms may not be optimal for the offspring. This study demonstrates that, although some animals require symbioses with specific coevolved, vertically transmitted microbial symbionts, other animals have evolved dependence on taxonomically variable micro-organisms of environmental origin.  2018 The Author.

"Helping effort in primitively eusocial wasps","In primitively eusocial and cooperatively breeding societies, there is substantial individual variation in helping effort that is not accounted for by variation in genetic relatedness. In primitively eusocial wasps, helpers have a significant chance of inheriting breeding positions. Recent models suggest that because helpers with greater expected future fitness have more to lose, they should invest less in rearing the dominant's offspring. Observations and experiments on the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata support this prediction: helpers nearer to the front of the queue to inherit dominance, and helpers that stand to inherit larger, more productive groups, work less hard. These findings support the view that variation in social traits is best understood from a life-history perspective. Group augmentation effects, where greater helping effort leads to direct benefits through increased group size, seem less important in wasps. Further studies are required to understand how conflicts over helping effort are resolved in social wasps.  Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.","MA174","","","",""
"Heterogenistics: An epistemological restructuring of biological and social sciences","The epistemology which sees intra-specific and intra-group heterogenization, symbiotization, interactive pattern-generating and change as basic principles produces types of theories and research strategies different from the epistemology based on the notions of intra-specific and intra-group uniformity, competition and stabilization.

This article compares five epistemologies including the two mentioned above in the context of the current epistemological transition in science, particularly due to the emergence of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in physics and differentiation-amplifying reciprocal causal models in mathematics and engineering, both of which consider the universe as pattern-generating, information-creating and evolving.  1977 Leiden University Press/Dr. W.

"Hierarchical effects of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks on cactus recruitment","AimsPlant facilitation is recognized as an important process, contributing not only to the ecology of individual species, but the diversity, organization and stability of communities as a whole. While decades of studies have enhanced our knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to plant facilitation, greater attention is now being given to the conditionality of the mechanisms, whereby multiple biotic and abiotic factors may act independently and jointly with one another in shaping plant-plant facilitation. Our objective was to evaluate the conditionality and hierarchy of mechanisms contributing to cactus germination and early seedling recruitment arising from plant-plant facilitation, including the effects of seed banks, rainfall, granivory and nurse plants. LocationBahia de Kina, Sonora, Mexico; Sonoran Desert of North America. MethodsWe employed descriptive analyses and a factorial experiment to examine the consequences of rainfall, nurse plants, granivory and seed banks for senita cactus recruitment (Pachycereus schottii) in two plant communities of the Sonoran Desert: one degraded of its key nurse plants and the other with its nurse plants intact. ResultsSeed banks did not occur in either of the plant communities, indicating that seed banks and seed dormancy do not affect senita recruitment and thereby do not modulate other mechanisms that contribute to nurse plant facilitation and cactus recruitment. Juvenile senita cacti were consistently associated with nurse plants in both plant communities. Yet, the density and species composition of nurse plants differed between the communities, resulting in reduced senita recruitment and shifts to alternative nurse plants in the community degraded of its key nurse plants compared to the intact community. In a factorial experiment manipulating rainfall, granivory and nurse plants, we found that rainfall and granivory had significant main factor effects, leading to increases and decreases in seedling recruitment, respectively. There was no main factor effect of nurse plants, but there was a significant nurse plant by granivory interaction, indicating that nurse plants increase seedling recruitment through escape from granivory conditional upon rainfall. ConclusionsTaken together, these results reveal a conditional hierarchy of mechanisms of plant-plant facilitation shaping senita cactus recruitment, namely the predominant effects of rainfall increasing recruitment and of granivory decreasing recruitment, for which nurse plants played a key role in increasing seedling recruitment with rainfall and by reducing granivory.","MA177","","","",""
"Host-pathogen interaction as a special case of interrelations between organisms","Plants are open systems and therefore maintain a vast number of complex relationships with the environment. Among these are: 1. Dependencies upon the external environment. 2. Strong influences on the environment. 3. Diverse interrelations with other organisms at different levels, of plant species among each other, and of plants with animals including human beings. According to the nature of the interaction various types of interrelations can be distinguished: (a) neutral relations (e.g. epiphytes), (b) mutualistic relations (fertilization, symbiosis), and (c) parasitic relations (incompatibility, the phytopathological host-parasite interactions). Pathogens can be defined as organisms out of place. As a result of special conditions defense reactions are observed in the stricken individuals such as irregular reactions on the metabolic level, formation of phytoalexins, competition for food, space, etc., involving also genetic interrelationships between hosts and their parasites. Such interrelations occurring on the cellular level include the problems of cell recognition, adherence of the cell surfaces to each other, and intercellular bridging. Interactions on the individual population and ecosystem levels can be reduced to aspects of the interactions, which involve mutual gene regulation.  1968 Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.","MA184","","","",""
"Host-symbiont-pathogen interactions in blood-feeding parasites: Nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange","Animals are common hosts of mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Blood-feeding parasites feed on a diet that is nutritionally unbalanced and thus often rely on symbionts to supplement essential nutrients. However, they are also of medical importance as they can be infected by pathogens such as bacteria, protists or viruses that take advantage of the blood-feeding nutritional strategy for own transmission. Since blood-feeding evolved multiple times independently in diverse animals, it showcases a gradient of host-microbe interactions. While some parasitic lineages are possibly asymbiotic and manage to supplement their diet from other food sources, other lineages are either loosely associated with extracellular gut symbionts or harbour intracellular obligate symbionts that are essential for the host development and reproduction. What is perhaps even more diverse are the pathogenic lineages that infect blood-feeding parasites. This microbial diversity not only puts the host into a complicated situation -distinguishing between microorganisms that can greatly decrease or increase its fitness -but also increases opportunity for horizontal gene transfer to occur in this environment. In this review, I first introduce this diversity of mutualistic and pathogenic microorganisms associated with blood-feeding animals and then focus on patterns in their interactions, particularly nutrition, immune cross-talk and gene exchange.  2018 Cambridge University Press.","MA185","","","",""
"Hot spots, cold spots, and the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution","Species interactions commonly coevolve as complex geographic mosaics of populations shaped by differences in local selection and gene flow. We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations ({''}hot spots{''}) but not in others ({''}cold spots{''}). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.","MA186","","","",""
"Impact of animal welfare on worldwide poultry production","Animal welfare has become an important issue in poultry production. Concern about poultry welfare has mainly been expressed in industrialised countries. Since trade of poultry products is highly internationalised, welfare aspects have to be considered by all countries involved. This paper reviews the changes in the attitude to animal welfare in Western societies and the related development of regulations and standards, the impact of high welfare standards on production costs and on international trade of poultry products and finally, the influence of different stakeholders on poultry production and marketing. From the 1960s onwards, animal welfare activities have been focused on farm animals kept under 'industrial' conditions, such as caged laying hens. Consequently, the management conditions for laying hens in Europe have been regulated in detail by national laws and EU-Directives. Meanwhile, conventional cages have been banned in the EU and welfare activities are now directed towards other issues, such as beak-trimming and killing day-old chicks of layer lines. All measures which are considered to improve the welfare of animals increase cost of production. Hence, differences in national welfare regulations are expected to relocate poultry production to countries with low welfare standards. There is a tendency that important retailers and food chains use welfare as a marketing argument and establish high price premium labels. Standards which are established and controlled by stakeholders of the poultry market are independent of national welfare legislation. This will lead to harmonisation of welfare standards on an international level. Most welfare labels have been developed by retailers in cooperation with welfare-oriented NGOs. There is a new trend in Germany where retailers and farmers organisations develop welfare schemes and poultry producers are paid an extra allowance for welfare-friendly production. This system ensures that poultry farmers are reimbursed for the welfare-related costs.  Copyright 2018 World's Poultry Science Association.","MA191","","","",""
"Independent origins of parasitism in Animalia","Nearly half of all animals may have a parasitic lifestyle, yet the number of transitions to parasitism and their potential for species diversification remain unresolved. Based on a comprehensive survey of the animal kingdom, we find that parasitism has independently evolved at least 223 times in just 15 phyla, with the majority of identified independent parasitic groups occurring in the Arthropoda, at or below the level of Family. Metazoan parasitology is dominated by the study of helminthes; however, only 20% of independently derived parasite taxa belong to those groups, with numerous transitions also seen in Mollusca, Rotifera, Annelida and Cnidaria. Parasitism is almost entirely absent from deuterostomes, and although worm-like morphology and host associations are widespread across Animalia, the dual symbiotic and trophic interactions required for parasitism may constrain its evolution from antecedent consumer strategies such as generalist predators and filter feeders. In general, parasitic groups do not differ from their free-living relatives in their potential for speciation. However, the 10 largest parasitic clades contain 90% of described parasitic species, or perhaps 40% of all animal species. Hence, a substantial fraction of animal diversity on the Earth arose following these few transitions to a parasitic trophic strategy.  2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Individual interaction data are required in community ecology: a conceptual review of the predator-prey mass ratio and more","Community ecology is traditionally species-based and assumes that species comprise identical individuals. However, intraspecific variation is ubiquitous in nature because of ontogenetic growth and critical in food-we dynamics. To understand individual interaction-mediated food webs, researchers have recently focused on body size as the most fundamental biological aspect and assessed a parameter called the predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR). Herein, I review the conceptual development of the PPMR and suggest four major concerns regarding its measurement: (1) PPMR should be measured at the individual level because species-averaged values distort actual feeding relationships, (2) individual-level PPMR data on gape-unconstrained predators (e.g., terrestrial carnivores) are limited because previous studies have targeted gape-limited fish predators, (3) predators' prey size selectivity (preferred PPRM) is conceptually different from dietary prey size (realized PPMR) and should be distinguished by incorporating environmental prey abundance information, and (4) determinants of preferred PPMR, rather than those of realized PPMR, should be identified to describe size-dependent predation. Future studies are encouraged to explore not only predation but also other interaction types (e.g., competition, mutualism, and herbivory) at the individual level. However, this is not likely to occur while ecological communities are still considered to be interspecific interaction networks. To resolve this situation and more comprehensively understand biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, I suggest that community ecology requires a paradigm shift in the unit of interaction from species to individuals, similar to evolutionary biology, which revolutionized the unit of selection, because interactions occur between individuals.","MA199","","","",""
"Individual variation in resource use by opossums leading to nested fruit consumption","Despite recent findings on the ecological relevance of within population diet variation far less attention has been devoted to the role diet variation for ecological services. Seed dispersal is a key ecological service, affecting plant fitness and regeneration based on foraging by fruit-eating vertebrates. Here we used a network approach, widely used to understand how seed-dispersal is organized at the species level, to gain insights into the patterns that emerge at the individual-level. We studied the individual fruit consumption behavior of a South American didelphid Didelphis albiventris, during the cool-dry and warm-wet seasons. In species-species networks the heterogeneity in specialization levels generates patterns such as nestedness and asymmetry. Because generalist populations may be comprised of specialized individuals, we hypo thesized that network structural properties, such as nestedness, should also emerge at the individual level. We detected variation in fruit consumption that was not related to resource availability, ontogenetic or sexual factors or sampling biases. Such variation resulted in the structural patterns often found in species-species seed-dispersal networks: low connectance, a high degree of nestedness and the absence of modules. Moreover structure varied between the warm-wet and cool-dry seasons, presumably as a consequence of seasonal fluctuation in fruit availability. Our findings suggest individuals may differ in selectivity causing asymmetries in seed dispersal efficiency within the population. In this sense the realized dispersal would differ from the expected dispersal estimated from their average dispersal potential. Additionally the results suggest possible frequency-dependent effects on seed dispersal that might affect individual plant performance and plant community composition.","MA202","","","",""
"Insect seed predators and environmental change","1. The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.","MA206","","","",""
"Intraspecific variation in allelochemistry determines an invasive species' impact on soil microbial communities","Invasive species can benefit from altered species interactions in their new range, and by interfering with species interactions among native competitors. Since exotic invasions are generally studied at the species level, relatively little is known about intraspecific variation in the traits that determine an invader's effect on native species. Alliaria petiolata is a widespread and aggressive invader of forest understories that succeeds in part by interfering with mutualistic interactions between native plants and soil fungi. Here, I show that the impact of A. petiolata on soil microbial communities varied among individuals due to variation in their allelochemical concentrations. The differential impacts translated into varied effects on native tree growth, partly because A. petiolata's allelochemicals preferentially affected the most mutualistic fungal taxa. These results highlight the importance of considering the spatial and temporal variation in an invasive species' impacts for understanding and managing the invasion process.","MA222","","","",""
"Intraspecific variation in colony founding behavior and social organization in the honey ant Myrmecocystus mendax","Persistent cooperation between unrelated reproductives occurs rarely in mature eusocial insect societies, and when present, is frequently geographically constrained. Here we present genetic and behavioral evidence showing that primary polygyny occurs in some, but not all populations of the honey ant Myrmecocystus mendax. Specifically, we found that all mature colonies sampled in a population in the Sierra Ancha Mountains of central Arizona (USA) were polygynous with a relatively high number of queens (average = 6.27), while the majority of mature colonies sampled in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona were monogynous. Field and laboratory observations showed that Chiricahua foundresses are primarily haplometrotic, whereas Sierra Ancha foundresses can be either haplometrotic or facultatively pleometrotic. Nestmate relatedness of mature Sierra Ancha field colonies suggests that the reproductive individuals within these colonies are unrelated, consistent with primary polygyny. In the laboratory, Sierra Ancha foundresses cooperatively established incipient colonies without queen reduction, and colonies with multiple queens produced more minims andworkers that may serve the role ofrepletes (honeypots) than haplometrotic colonies. This was in stark contrast to foundresses from the Chiricahua population, which showed strong aggression when forced to found colonies together in the laboratory. When brood raiding was experimentally induced between laboratory Sierra Ancha colonies, queens from colonies with more workers had a higher survival probability, although in some cases the competing colonies fused and queens from both colonies continued to reproduce. Fusion between incipient ant colonies is a rare phenomenon, but could contribute to the high frequency of polygyny and high queen number in mature colonies in the Sierra Ancha population.  2019, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).","MA223","","","",""
"Investigating the causes and consequences of symbiont shuffling in a multi-partner reef coral symbiosis under environmental change","Dynamic symbioses may critically mediate impacts of climate change on diverse organisms, with repercussions for ecosystem persistence in some cases. On coral reefs, increases in heat-tolerant symbionts after thermal bleaching can reduce coral susceptibility to future stress. However, the relevance of this adaptive response is equivocal owing to conflicting reports of symbiont stability and change.We help reconcile this conflict by showing that change in symbiont community composition (symbiont shuffling) in Orbicella faveolata depends on the disturbance severity and recovery environment. The proportion of heat-tolerant symbionts dramatically increased following severe experimental bleaching, especially in a warmer recovery environment, but tended to decrease if bleaching was less severe. These patterns can be explained by variation in symbiont performance in the changing microenvironments created by differentially bleached host tissues. Furthermore, higher proportions of heat-tolerant symbionts linearly increased bleaching resistance but reduced photochemical efficiency, suggesting that any change in community structure oppositely impacts performance and stress tolerance. Therefore, even minor symbiont shuffling can adaptively benefit corals, although fitness effects of resulting trade-offs are difficult to predict. This work helps elucidate causes and consequences of dynamism in symbiosis, which is critical to predicting responses of multi-partner symbioses such as O. faveolata to environmental change.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

"Linking neuroethology to the chemical biology of natural products: interactions between cone snails and their fish prey, a case study","From a biological perspective, a natural product can be defined as a compound evolved by an organism for chemical interactions with another organism including prey, predator, competitor, pathogen, symbiont or host. Natural products hold tremendous potential as drug leads and have been extensively studied by chemists and biochemists in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the biological purpose for which a natural product evolved is rarely addressed. By focusing on a well-studied group of natural products-venom components from predatory marine cone snails-this review provides a rationale for why a better understanding of the evolution, biology and biochemistry of natural products will facilitate both neuroscience and the potential for drug leads. The larger goal is to establish a new sub-discipline in the broader field of neuroethology that we refer to as ``Chemical Neuroethology{''}, linking the substantial work carried out by chemists on natural products with accelerating advances in neuroethology.","MA233","","","",""
"Modelling the co-evolution of indirect genetic effects and inherited variability","When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies, however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture. Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal individual and of the difference in trait value between the social partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection. Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases, i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller. Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.","MA245","","","",""
"Multidimensional analyses of physical performance reveal a size-dependent trade-off between suites of traits","1. Animal movement is multidimensional and complex, and to understand the motor system of wild animals in the context of their natural ecology, we must analyse how suites of performance traits both mutualistically and antagonistically affect function-a necessity highlighted by previous work on performance trade-offs. 2. Evidence from some studies of human athletes using multidimensional analyses of performance suggests that overall quality among individuals can mask functional trade-offs within them, yet no studies have tested this idea using wild animals. In this study, we investigated the possible mutualistic and antagonistic associations among eight different whole-animal performance traits in male and female northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus). 3. We detected trade-offs between pairs of performance traits when conducted on raw standardized data using both Pearson product moment correlations and partial correlation analyses. For example, grasp strength was negatively associated with beam-running speed using both analyses, suggesting that morphological designs that enhance grasp strength simultaneously compromise an animal's motor control or stability on a narrow beam. 4. In addition, we detected a trade-off between two distinct sets of performance traits; grasp strength, bite force and maximum oxygen consumption were negatively associated with jump acceleration and beam-running speed. This trade-off between sets of performance traits accounted for around one-third of the total variance in performance among individuals and was primarily driven by the effects of body size on both groups of traits. Larger body sizes improved grasp strength, bite forces and maximum oxygen consumption rates but decreased jump accelerations and beam-running speeds. 5. Because the first component of a principal component analysis based on all eight performance traits (PC(P)1) did not load in the same direction for all traits, PC(P)1 did not represent an overall metric of motor performance-which differs from previous multivariate analyses of human physical performance. Our study highlights the importance of studying suites of traits when exploring the functional phenotype of organisms rather than just one or two dimensions of performance.","MA251","","","",""
"Mutualism, market effects and partner control","Intraspecific cooperation and interspecific mutualism often feature a marked asymmetry in the scope for exploitation. Cooperation may nevertheless persist despite one-sided opportunities for cheating, provided that the partner vulnerable to exploitation has sufficient control over the duration of interaction. The effectiveness of the threat of terminating an encounter, however, depends upon the ease with which both the potential victim and the potential exploiter can find replacement partners. Here, we extend a simple, game-theoretical model of this form of partner control to incorporate variation in the relative abundance of potential victims and exploiters, which leads to variation in the time required for individuals of each type to find a new partner. We show that such market effects have a dramatic influence on the stable level of exploitation (and consequent duration of interaction). As the relative abundance of victims decreases, they become less tolerant to exploitation, terminating encounters earlier (for a given level of exploitation), whereas exploiters behave in a more cooperative manner. As a result, the stable duration of interaction actually increases, despite the decreasing tolerance of the victims. Below a critical level of relative victim abundance, the model suggests that the cost of finding a replacement partner becomes so great that it does not pay to exploit at all.","MA252","","","",""
"Neanderthal hunting strategies inferred from mortality profiles within the Abric Roman sequence","Ungulate mortality profiles are commonly used to study Neanderthal subsistence strategies. To assess the hunting strategies used by Neanderthals, we studied the ages at death of the cervids and equids found in levels E, H, I, Ja, Jb, K, L and M of the Abric Roman sequence. These levels date between 43.2  1.1 ka BP (14C AMS) and 54.5  1.7 ka BP (U-series). The degree of eruption and development of the teeth and their wear stages were used to determine the ages of these animals at death, and mortality profiles were constructed using these data. The equids display prime dominated profiles in all of the analyzed levels, whereas the cervids display variable profiles. These results suggest that the Neanderthals of Abric Roman employed both selective and non-selective hunting strategies. The selective strategy focused on the hunting of prime adults and generated prime dominated profiles. On the other hand, non-selective strategies, involved the consumption of animals of variable ages, resulting in catastrophic profiles. It is likely that in the selective hunting events were conducted using selective ambushes in which it was possible to select specific prey animals. On the other hand, encounter hunting or non-selective ambush hunting may have also been used at times, based on the abundances of prey animals and encounter rates. Specific hunting strategies would have been developed accordance with the taxa and the age of the individual to be hunted. The hunting groups most likely employed cooperative hunting techniques, especially in the capture of large animals. Thus, it is not possible to uniquely associate a single mortality profile with the predation tactics of Neanderthals at Abric Roman.  2017 Marn et al.

"Parallel and nonparallel behavioural evolution in response to parasitism and predation in Trinidadian guppies","Natural enemies such as predators and parasites are known to shape intraspecific variability of behaviour and personality in natural populations, yet several key questions remain: (i) What is the relative importance of predation vs. parasitism in shaping intraspecific variation of behaviour across generations? (ii) What are the contributions of genetic and plastic effects to this behavioural divergence? (iii) And to what extent are responses to predation and parasitism repeatable across independent evolutionary lineages? We addressed these questions using Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) (i) varying in their exposure to dangerous fish predators and Gyrodactylus ectoparasites for (ii) both wild-caught F0 and laboratory-reared F2 individuals and coming from (iii) multiple independent evolutionary lineages (i.e. independent drainages). Several key findings emerged. First, a population's history of predation and parasitism influenced behavioural profiles, but to different extent depending on the behaviour considered (activity, shoaling or boldness). Second, we had evidence for some genetic effects of predation regime on behaviour, with differences in activity of F2 laboratory-reared individuals, but not for parasitism, which had only plastic effects on the boldness of wild-caught F0 individuals. Third, the two lineages showed a mixture of parallel and nonparallel responses to predation/parasitism, with parallel responses being stronger for predation than for parasitism and for activity and boldness than for shoaling. These findings suggest that different sets of behaviours provide different pay-offs in alternative predation/parasitism environments and that parasitism has more transient effects in shaping intraspecific variation of behaviour than does predation.  2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

"Parasitic and symbiotic fauna in oysters (Crassostrea virginica) collected from the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary in Florida","Studies of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, collected from 10 sites in the Caloosahatchee River and Estuary, Florida, revealed a varied parasite and symbiotic faunae that have never been reported in this area. Organisms observed included ovacystis virus infecting gametes at four sites (prevalence <1%), ciliate protozoans Ancistrocoma sp. in the gut of a stressed oyster at one site and Sphenophrya sp. infecting the gills of animals at three sites (prevalence <1%). The gregarine protozoan Nematopsis was found at all 10 sites (prevalence 24% to 90%) and oysters at some sites had concurrent infections of Nematopsis prytherchi and Nematopsis ostrearum in connective tissue near the stomach, mantle, and gills.

The first two trematodes were found infesting the gonoducts of their hosts while sporocysts of Bucephalus sp. infected connective tissues and gonads. Metacestodes of a species in the genus Tylocephalum were found in vesicular connective tissues near the gut, mantle, and in the gills of animals at all sites (prevalence 7% to 58%).

"Phylosymbiosis: Relationships and Functional Effects of Microbial Communities across Host Evolutionary History","Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern, whereby the ecological relatedness of host-associated microbial communities parallels the phylogeny of related host species. Here, we test the prevalence of phylosymbiosis and its functional significance under highly controlled conditions by characterizing the microbiota of 24 animal species from four different groups (Peromyscus deer mice, Drosophila flies, mosquitoes, and Nasonia wasps), and we reevaluate the phylosymbiotic relationships of seven species of wild hominids. We demonstrate three key findings. First, intraspecific microbiota variation is consistently less than interspecific microbiota variation, and microbiota-based models predict host species origin with high accuracy across the dataset. Interestingly, the age of host clade divergence positively associates with the degree of microbial community distinguishability between species within the host clades, spanning recent host speciation events (~1 million y ago) to more distantly related host genera (~108 million y ago). Second, topological congruence analyses of each group's complete phylogeny and microbiota dendrogram reveal significant degrees of phylosymbiosis, irrespective of host clade age or taxonomy. Third, consistent with selection on hostmicrobiota interactions driving phylosymbiosis, there are survival and performance reductions when interspecific microbiota transplants are conducted between closely related and divergent host species pairs. Overall, these findings indicate that the composition and functional effects of an animal's microbial community can be closely allied with host evolution, even across wide-ranging timescales and diverse animal systems reared under controlled conditions.  2016 Brooks et al.","MA278","","","",""
"Potential for endophyte symbiosis to increase resistance of the native grass Poa alsodes to invasion by the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum","Microbial symbionts can improve the competitive ability and stress tolerance of plant hosts and thus may enhance native plant resistance against invaders. We investigated whether symbiosis between a native grass, Poa alsodes, and a fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) improved the grass's ability to compete against Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a common invader in the eastern USA. We challenged naturally endophyte-symbiotic and experimentally endophyte-free P. alsodes plants with the invader. In the first experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and water availability to test for context-dependency in symbiont benefits. In the second experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and M. vimineum diversity (the number of invader populations), since greater intraspecific diversity is expected to improve invasion success and might alter the efficacy of symbiosis in invasion resistance. In both experiments, presence of the endophyte reduced the per plant biomass of M. vimineum and increased P. alsodes biomass. We found no evidence that benefits of the symbiont depended on water availability, and population-level diversity had a minor influence on M. vimineum: inflorescence number showed a parabolic relationship with increasing numbers of M. vimineum populations. Overall, symbiosis in the native grass had stronger effects on invader growth than either water availability or invader genetic diversity. Our results suggest that endophyte symbioses in native plants can increase host performance against an invader, although this conclusion needs confirmation in more complex field settings where other important factors, such as herbivores and fluctuating abiotic conditions, come into play.

"Rates of parasitism, but not allocation of egg resources, vary among and within hosts of a generalist avian brood parasite","Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) deposit their eggs into the nests of other birds, which then raise the cowbird chick. Female cowbirds thus have limited options for impacting their offsprings development via maternal effects compared to most other passerines. Cowbirds can impact their offsprings phenotype by choosing among potential host nests, and by adjusting egg resources based on host characteristics. To examine whether cowbirds exhibit either or both of these strategies, we investigated rates of cowbird parasitism and egg investment (egg size, yolk-to-albumen ratio, and yolk testosterone and androstenedione) among and within host species in a shrubland bird community. We found that the probability of being parasitized by cowbirds, controlling for host status as a cowbird egg accepter or rejecter and ordinal date, varied significantly among host species, indicating an apparent preference for some hosts. Parasitism rates did not differ with host size, however, and despite variation in cowbird egg size among host species, this variation was not related to host size or cowbird preference. Among host species with eggs that are larger than those of the cowbird, cowbirds were significantly more likely to parasitize nests with relatively smaller eggs, whereas parasitism rates did not vary with relative egg size in host species with smaller eggs. There was no evidence for variation in cowbird egg components among or within host species. Our data indicate that cowbirds discriminate among host nests, but do not appear to adjust the composition of their eggs based on inter- or intraspecific host variation.  2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","MA299","","","",""
"Recombination and selection shape the molecular diversity pattern of nitrogen-fixing Sinorhizobium sp associated to Medicago","We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a sympatric population of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium medicae. These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the genus Medicago. A set of 116 isolates were obtained from a soil sample, from root nodules of three groups of plants representing among-species, within-species and intraline diversity in the Medicago genus. Bacteria were characterized by sequencing at seven loci evenly distributed along the genome of both Sinorhizobium species, covering the chromosome and the two megaplasmids. We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity recovered. Using the same data set, we then analyse the selective pattern at each locus. There was no relationship between the diversity of Medicago plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their symbionts. However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different megaplasmids. Purifying selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod genomic region, which includes genes involved in nodulation specificity, whereas balancing selection was detected in the exo region, close to genes involved in exopolysaccharide production. Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial symbionts, with a possible conflict of interest between plants and cheater bacterial genotypes. Recombination appears to occur preferentially within and among loci located on megaplasmids, rather than within the chromosome. Thus, recombination may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different loci.","MA300","","","",""
"Sex differences in intrasexual aggression among sex-role-reversed, cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Julidochromis regani","In sex-role-reversed species, females compete for resources (e.g., mates) more intensively than do males. However, it remains unclear whether these species exhibit sex differences in the intensity of aggressive behavior in the context of within-sex contests. Cichlid fish in the genus Julidochromis exhibit intraspecific variation in mating systems, ranging from monogamy to cooperative polyandry with sex-role reversal. In the study reported here, we observed aggressive interactions among three same-sex individuals in Julidochromis regani in the laboratory and tested whether inter-female aggression was more intense than inter-male aggression. Although difference in body size strongly determined the direction of aggression in fish, aggression by a smaller-sized individuals toward larger ones was occasionally observed. This type of aggression was common between individuals of a similar body size (<= 5 mm) and occurred more frequently among females than males. In contrast, differences in body size and sex did not affect the frequency of aggression by larger-sized individuals against smaller ones. Bidirectional aggression (i.e., mouth fighting) occurred frequently when two individuals had similar body size, and there was no difference in its frequency between sexes. However, temporal analysis showed that females performed bidirectional aggression more persistently than males. These sex differences in the intensity of intrasexual aggression could be the behavioral mechanisms underpinning cooperative polyandry.","MA315","","","",""
"Sexual and Social Behavior of Crustacea","The Crustacea represents one of the major branches in the tree of animal life, displaying diversity in form and lifestyle that rival those of the vertebrates and insects. But perhaps because of the primarily aquatic habits of crustaceans, they have received much less attention in evolutionary ecology than mostly terrestrial taxa. The chapters in this book make clear the richness of adaptations of crustaceans to social and sexual life, and their still largely untapped potential to test fundamental theory in behavioral ecology and evolution. Kinship, cooperation, and conflict play an important role in social evolution, modulated by extrinsic factors (resource competition, predation or parasitism), some of which have only recently begun to be studied. There are rich opportunities awaiting the student willing to pursue them, both in clarifying the social and sexual biology of individual crustacean species and in exploiting the Crustacea in broad comparative approaches to testing evolutionary theory.

"Sexual cooperation relies on food controlled by females in agromyzid flies","A sex difference in mating optima generates antagonistic traits that impose costs on the opposite sex. This conflict can be mediated by food that increases mutual benefits. Although current understanding of sexual cooperation involving food is based exclusively on mating systems with male food control, recent studies have suggested universal female food control across taxa. However, there have been no empirical studies testing food's role in facilitating sexual cooperation in this scenario. Here, we examined the interplay of food availability and mating in the pea leafminer, Liriomyza huidobrensis, the males of which feed on the exudates from the leaf punctures created by female ovipositors. Given the association between female oviposition and food production, we infer that food controlled by females may alter male optima in mating and thus modulate male courtship strategies for mating. Mating stimulated females to produce abundant punctures, which benefited male feeding and survival. When males were deprived of the punctures, they adopted an elaborate dancing behaviour, leading to increased receptivity of females. However, when males adopted an alternative strategy of directly approaching females, they obtained fewer punctures. After preferential mating with dancing males, females significantly prolonged their life span and increased offspring numbers. Sexual cooperation in leafminers can be explained by the nutritional composition of plant exudates, which we found contain abundant sugars and amino acids. The plant exudates are vital food for males, but their nutritional value and availability rapidly declined with time. Our study reveals that the food produced by females can provide mutual benefits to male survival and female reproduction. Our study of food control by females extends our understanding of evolution in sexual cooperation.  2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","MA321","","","",""
"Simple foraging rules in competitive environments can generate socially structured populations","Social vertebrates commonly form foraging groups whose members repeatedly interact with one another and are often genetically related. Many species also exhibit within-population specializations, which can range from preferences to forage in particular areas through to specializing on the type of prey they catch. However, within-population structure in foraging groups, behavioral homogeneity in foraging behavior, and relatedness could be outcomes of behavioral interactions rather than underlying drivers. We present a simple process by which grouping among foragers emerges and is maintained across generations. We introduce agent-based models to investigate (1) whether a simple rule (keep foraging with the same individuals when you were successful) leads to stable social community structure, and (2) whether this structure is robust to demographic changes and becomes kin-structured over time. We find the rapid emergence of kin-structured populations and the presence of foraging groups that control, or specialize on, a particular food resource. This pattern is strongest in small populations, mirroring empirical observations. Our results suggest that group stability can emerge as a product of network self-organization and, in doing so, may provide the necessary conditions for the evolution of more sophisticated processes, such as social learning. This taxonomically general social process has implications for our understanding of the links between population, genetic, and social structures.","MA323","","","",""
"Small-scale spatial heterogeneity in infection levels by symbionts of the amphipod Talorchestia quoyana (Talitridae)","The beach hopper amphipod Talorchestia quoyana is not distributed homogeneously in its sandy beach habitat, but instead occurs in dense patches under large pieces of tidal debris. This marked patchiness on a scale of just a few metres may create a higher level of aggregation among hosts for the symbionts and parasites of beach hoppers. Prevalence of infection by a mermithid nematode parasite varied significantly among 5 beach hopper patches, located within a few hundred metres of one another, on a New Zealand sandy beach. Similarly, the prevalence and mean intensity of infection by rhabditid nematodes and mites also varied significantly among beach hopper patches. This variation is not due to differences in amphipod sizes among patches, as the effect of size was controlled in the analysis. The symbionts and parasites were aggregated among individual amphipods within patches, with rhabditid nematodes also aggregated among patches, reflecting a higher, independent scale of aggregation. There were also positive associations between rhabditid nematodes and both mermithid nematodes and mites across host individuals, suggesting that individual variation among amphipods in susceptibility to symbionts may account for their aggregation within patches. These results indicate that the loosely fragmented distribution of beach hoppers is linked to a higher scale aggregation of their parasites and symbionts, a phenomenon that may impact on their population biology and that of the host.","MA326","","","",""
"Small-scale spatial variability in the distribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi affects plant performance and fungal diversity","The effects of spatial heterogeneity in negative biological interactions on individual performance and species diversity have been studied extensively. However, little is known about the respective effects involving positive biological interactions, including the symbiosis between plants and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. Using a greenhouse bioassay, we explored how spatial heterogeneity of natural soil inoculum influences the performance of pine seedlings and composition of their root-associated EM fungi. When the inoculum was homogenously distributed, a single EM fungal taxon dominated the roots of most pine seedlings, reducing the diversity of EM fungi at the treatment level, while substantially improving pine seedling performance. In contrast, clumped inoculum allowed the proliferation of several different EM fungi, increasing the overall EM fungal diversity. The most dominant EM fungal taxon detected in the homogeneous treatment was also a highly beneficial mutualist, implying that the trade-off between competitive ability and mutualistic capacity does not always exist.  2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS","MA327","","","",""
"Social influences on survival and reproduction: Insights from a long-term study of wild baboons","For social species, the environment has two components: physical and social. The social environment modifies the individual's interaction with the physical environment, and the physical environment may in turn impact individuals social relationships. This interplay can generate considerable variation among individuals in survival and reproduction. Here, I synthesize more than four decades of research on the baboons of the Amboseli basin in southern Kenya to illustrate how social and physical environments interact to affect reproduction and survival. For immature baboons, social behaviour can both mitigate and exacerbate the challenge of survival. Only c. 50% of live-born females and c. 44% of live-born males reach the median age of first reproduction. Variation in pre-adult survival, growth and development is associated with multiple aspects of the social environment. For instance, conspecifics provide direct care and are a major source of social knowledge about food and the environment, but conspecifics can also represent a direct threat to survival through infanticide. In adulthood, both competition (within and between social groups) and cooperative affiliation (i.e. collective action and/or the exchange of social resources such as grooming) are prominent features of baboon social life and have important consequences for reproduction and survival. For instance, adult females with higher social dominance ranks have accelerated reproduction, and adult females that engage in more frequent affiliative social interactions have higher survival throughout adulthood. The early life environment also has important consequences for adult reproduction and survival, as in a number of other bird and mammal species. In seasonal breeders, early life effects often apply to entire cohorts; in contrast, in nonseasonal and highly social species such as baboons, early life effects are more individual-specific, stemming from considerable variation not only in the early physical environment (even if they are born in the same year) but also in the particulars of their social environment.  2018 The Authors.

"Species traits dictate seasonal-dependent responses of octocoralalgal symbioses to elevated temperature and ultraviolet radiation","Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can exacerbate the effects of elevated seawater temperatures concomitant with climate change. Such stressors can collapse the mutualism of scleractinian corals with their endosymbiotic unicellular algae, Symbiodinium spp. Conversely, we found that the Caribbean octocorals Pseudoplexaura crucis and Eunicea tourneforti coped with thermal and UVR stress. But, the responses differed and depended on the species biochemical properties. Furthermore, the effects of the stressors varied seasonally. For 7d, during summer and winter, we exposed the octocorals to either 3C above ambient temperature, UVR, or both. In either season, the stressors did not affect protein or carbohydrate content nor the Symbiodinium genotype. At the elevated temperature in the summer, the lipid content in P. crucis fell alongside a 35% decline in Symbiodinium. Conversely, in E. tourneforti, algal density dropped 26% with no lipid loss. In both species, the remaining Symbiodinium retained their chlorophyll and carotenoid content. In the winter, + 3C and UVR led to increased algal density, mitotic index, and chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. Temperature affected more parameters than UVR, but additive, synergistic and antagonistic interactions occurred. These findings show the resilience of Caribbean gorgonian corals against stressful environmental conditions and highlight the importance of including organismal biochemical differences and seasonal responses into interpreting the effects of multiple stressors associated with global climate change.  2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","MA347","","","",""
"Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control","Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive controla set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different groups of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory posits that correlated and anticorrelated brain activity may signify cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas that subserve adaptive behavior. In this study, we use a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological motifs of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquire fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they perform two cognitive control tasksa Stroop interference task and a local-global perception switching task using Navon figureseach with low and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we construct dynamic functional brain networks and use a parts-based, network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captures distributed network structures involved in different phases of cooperative and competitive control processes. Our results demonstrate that temporal expression of the subgraphs fluctuate alongside changes in cognitive demand and are associated with individual differences in task performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of cognitive systems map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.  2018 Khambhati et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.","MA356","","","",""
"Symbiotic sympatric speciation through interaction-driven phenotype differentiation","A mechanism of genetic diversification and reproductive isolation is presented based on the interaction-induced diversification of phenotypes. First, phenotypes of individuals with identical genotypes split into a few groups, according to instability in the developmental dynamics associated with the interaction among individuals. Later, through competition for reproduction and mutational change of genes, the phenotypic differences are fixed to genes, until the groups ('species') are completely separated in terms of genes as well as phenotypes. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed theory for speciation works also under sexual recombination and provides a basis for the evolution of mating preference. The relevance of the results to natural evolution are discussed, including incomplete penetrance in mutants and the change in flexibility in genotype-phenotype correspondence. Possible experiments are proposed to verify the theory presented.","MA359","","","",""
"The behavioural ecology of personality: consistent individual differences from an adaptive perspective","Individual humans, and members of diverse other species, show consistent differences in aggressiveness, shyness, sociability and activity. Such intraspecific differences in behaviour have been widely assumed to be non-adaptive variation surrounding (possibly) adaptive population-average behaviour. Nevertheless, in keeping with recent calls to apply Darwinian reasoning to ever-finer scales of biological variation, we sketch the fundamentals of an adaptive theory of consistent individual differences in behaviour. Our thesis is based on the notion that such `personality differences' can be selected for if fitness payoffs are dependent on both the frequencies with which competing strategies are played and an individual's behavioural history. To this end, we review existing models that illustrate this and propose a game theoretic approach to analyzing personality differences that is both dynamic and state-dependent. Our motivation is to provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of an apparently common animal trait: personality, which has far reaching ecological and evolutionary implications.","MA363","","","",""
"The effect of attachment and environmental manipulations on cooperative behavior in the prisoner's dilemma game","Cooperation and competition are vital for human survival and for social progress. In this study we examine the impact of external (environmental) and internal (individual differences) factors on the tendency to cooperate or compete in social conflicts. To this end, 53 young adults played blocks of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with each other or with a computer. The environmental context was manipulated across blocks, by introducing uncertainty, randomly losing or gaining money. Individual differences were assessed by participants' attachment style. We found that participants cooperated more when randomly losing money compared to when randomly winning or in the neutral condition. Moreover, in a negative uncertain environment, individuals with higher anxious and avoidant attachment styles cooperated less. The above effects were only observed when playing against a human and not a computer. Overall, the findings highlight the dependency of cooperative behavior on the context as driven by external and internal factors.","MA369","","","",""
"The fundamental role of competition in the ecology and evolution of mutualisms","Mutualisms are interspecific interactions that yield reciprocal benefits. Here, by adopting a consumer-resource perspective, we show how considering competition is necessary in order to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of mutualism. We first review the ways in which competition shapes the ecology of mutualisms, using a graphical framework based on resource flows rather than net effects to highlight the opportunities for competition. We then describe the known mechanisms of competition and show how it is a critical driver of the evolutionary dynamics, persistence, and diversification of mutualism. We argue that empirical and theoretical research on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms will jointly progress by addressing four key points: (i) the existence and shape of physiological trade-offs among cooperation, competition, and other life-history and functional traits; (ii) the capacity for individuals to express conditional responses to variation in their mutualistic and competitive environment; (iii) the existence of heritable variation for mutualistic and competitive traits and their potentially conditional expression; and (iv) the structure of the network of consumer-resource interactions in which individuals are embedded.","MA377","","","",""
"The oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi supports a Cretaceous diversification of fungal-arthropod symbioses","Paleoophiocordyceps coccophagus, a fungal parasite of a scale insect from the Early Cretaceous (Upper Albian), is reported and described here. This fossil not only provides the oldest fossil evidence of animal parasitism by fungi but also contains morphological features similar to asexual states of Hirsutella and Hymenostilbe of the extant genus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota). Because species of Hypocreales collectively exhibit a broad range of nutritional modes and symbioses involving plants, animals and other fungi, we conducted ancestral host reconstruction coupled with phylogenetic dating analyses calibrated with P. coccophagus. These results support a plant-based ancestral nutritional mode for Hypocreales, which then diversified ecologically through a dynamic process of intra- and interkingdom host shifts involving fungal, higher plant and animal hosts. This is especially evident in the families Cordycipitaceae, Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae, which are characterized by a high occurrence of insect pathogens. The ancestral ecologies of Clavicipitaceae and Ophiocordycipitaceae are inferred to be animal pathogens, a trait inherited from a common ancestor, whereas the ancestral host affiliation of Cordycipitaceae was not resolved. Phylogenetic dating supports both a Jurassic origin of fungal-animal symbioses within Hypocreales and parallel diversification of all three insect pathogenic families during the Cretaceous, concurrent with the diversification of insects and angiosperms.

"The ubiquitous and varied role of infection in the lives of animals and plants","Parasitic and symbiotic infections are major forces governing the life histories of plant and animal hosts-a fact that is ever more evident because of recent findings emanating from diverse subdisciplines of biology. Yet, infectious organisms have been relatively little investigated by biologists who study natural populations. Now that new molecular and computational tools allow us to differentiate and track microscopic infectious agents in nature, we are beginning to establish a better appreciation of their effects on larger, more familiar organisms. This special issue on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of infection for plants and animals is based on the annual Vice Presidential Symposium at the meeting of the American Society of Naturalists held in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the summer of 2001.","MA389","","","",""
"The varying relationship between helping and individual quality","Individuals of different quality often differ in their helping behavior, but sometimes it is the high-quality individuals who help most (e.g., human meat sharing, vigilance) and other times it is the low-quality individuals (e.g., reproductive queues, primate grooming). We argue that these differences depend on individual differences in the performance costs of actually helping, the opportunity costs from forsaking alternative activities, and the fitness benefits for engaging the help. If helping is more difficult for some individuals to do (quality-dependent help), it will usually be done by high-quality individuals, whereas help that all individuals could do equally well (quality-independent help) will be done by whoever pays lower opportunity costs. Our model makes novel predictions about many kinds of helping, allows us to categorize different types of helping by their relationship with individual quality, and is general enough to apply to many situations. Furthermore, it can be generalized to any other type of (nonhelping) behavior where there are individual differences in benefits, performance costs, or opportunity costs.","MA390","","","",""
"Trade-offs between social learning and individual innovativeness in common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus","Social learning and innovation are two different ways to acquire novel behaviours, and the form of the relationship between these two processes strongly affects cultural evolution. Whereas modelling results suggest a negative correlation between the two processes within a species, comparative data show, and the cultural intelligence hypothesis predicts, positive covariation across species. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty about the form of the relationship between social learning and innovation. We explored this problem experimentally in common marmosets. Social learning of 18 subjects was assessed by presenting a video clip of a conspecific demonstrator solving a complex foraging task and comparing their success to a control group. For the same subjects, the propensity to innovate was assessed with two tasks that operationalize different types of innovation: (1) a multistage problem-solving task to estimate goal-directed Type I innovation, that is, the ability to find a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, and (2) a flexibility task testing for more incidental Type II innovation, that is, the propensity to realize and switch to a novel, but easier solution after the establishment of a well-learned solution. Social learning was negatively correlated with Type II innovation, but not with Type I innovation. We discuss these results with regard to competition within an individual of the various attentional processes aimed at conspecifics' behaviour or aspects of the environment, and whether they might be the result of the cooperative breeding system shared by humans and callitrichids.

"Turn-taking ceremonies in a colonial seabird: Does behavioral variation signal individual condition?","In species with biparental care, pairs share a cooperative interest in offspring survival but may be in conflict over their relative investments, as reported in recent turn-taking studies of chick-provisioning birds. Turn-taking in Common Murres (Uria aalge) involves the foraging bird returning to the colony to provision the chick and the brooding parent departing. We examined whether Common Murres in poor condition had slower or more irregular turn-taking behavior, as has been documented in Common Murres equipped with geologgers. Irregularities include the brooding bird not trading parental roles with its returning mate or a bird returning to the colony without a fish. Irregular turn-taking sequences generally took longer than normal turn-taking sequences and differed in the rate and synchrony of allopreening, the main interactive behavior between mates. There was a delayed onset of allopreening when nest reliefs were protracted, whereas returners that did not bring a fish started allopreening sooner than either their brooding partners or other returners that brought a fish. Common Murres in better condition (higher body mass and lower lipid metabolite levels) left the colony sooner after their returning mates fed the chick compared to Common Murres in worse condition. Birds with higher chick-feeding rates brought fish back in more visits, which suggests that these were higher-quality birds. When birds vary in their turn-taking ceremonial behaviors, they may be negotiating by providing their partners with cues about their condition. Since Common Murres have long-term pair bonds and both parents are necessary to raise offspring, mates should respond to information from their partners if they can do so without compromising their own condition beyond a critical threshold.  2017 American Ornithological Society.","MA398","","","",""
"Under high stakes and uncertainty the rich should lend the poor a helping hand","In social dilemmas, there is tension between individual incentives to optimize personal gain versus social benefits. An additional cause of conflict in such social dilemmas is heterogeneity. Cultural differences or financial inequity often interfere with decision making when a diverse group of individuals interact. We address these issues in situations where individuals are either rich or poor. Often, it is unclear how rich and poor individuals should interact should the poor invest the same as the rich, or should the rich assist the poor? Which distribution of efforts can be considered as fair? To address the effects of heterogeneity on decisions, we model a collective-risk dilemma where players collectively have to invest more than a certain threshold, with heterogeneity and multiple rounds. We aim to understand the natural behavior and to infer which strategies are particularly stable in such asymmetric collective-risk games. Large scale individual based simulations show that when the poor players have half of the wealth the rich players posses, the poor contribute only when early contributions are made by the rich players. The rich contribute on behalf of the poor only when their own external assets are worth protecting. Under a certain degree of uncertainty we observe the rich maintain cooperation by assisting the poor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","MA399","","","",""
"When cooperation begets cooperation: The role of key individuals in galvanizing support","Life abounds with examples of conspecifics actively cooperating to a common end, despite conflicts of interest being expected concerning how much each individual should contribute. Mathematical models typically find that such conflict can be resolved by partial-response strategies, leading investors to contribute relatively equitably. Using a case study approach, we show that such model expectations can be contradicted in at least four disparate contexts: (i) bi-parental care; (ii) cooperative breeding; (iii) cooperative hunting; and (iv) human cooperation. We highlight that: (a) marked variation in contributions is commonplace; and (b) individuals can often respond positively rather than negatively to the contributions of others. Existing models have surprisingly limited power in explaining these phenomena. Here, we propose that, although among-individual variation in cooperative contributions will be influenced by differential costs and benefits, there is likely to be a strong genetic or epigenetic component. We then suggest that selection can maintain high investors (key individuals) when their contributions promote support by increasing the benefits and/or reducing the costs for others. Our intentions are to raise awareness inand provide testable hypotheses oftwo of the most poorly understood, yet integral, questions regarding cooperative ventures: why do individuas vary in their contributions and when does cooperation beget cooperation?.  2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
